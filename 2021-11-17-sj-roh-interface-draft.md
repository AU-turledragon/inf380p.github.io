# Update:

For this week, I managed to check a few items off the checklists, specifically: Choose data files to use in the trinket. (CHECK), 
Brainstorm how to set up the structure of the program: CSV upload (CHECK), and Begin to code, but start light with foundational lines (CHECK).
There is still a lot of work to be done, but I was glad to get off to a start. I focused on functionality, and laying down some groundwork for 
the interaction between the user via text input and the program. For each option within the main menu, this sketch displays some of the functionalities 
that I have planned: Selecting a data set to find a summary statistic (2), Creating a histogram (3). 

Below is the trinket code:

New modifications (added items to my old checklist - copied below):
- Must figure out how to deal with option 3: Creating a histogram, what are the necessary steps for the user to go through?
- How to add code to carry out these ideas


#Old Plan:

# Project Idea:

For the final project, I have decided to do a data analysis project. I want to focus on using the tools that we learned in class over the semester to follow
Professor's recommendation of building an exploratory analysis tool for users to print out graphs (histogram) and summary statistics of data sets. These summary
statistics will include min, median, mean, sd, and max. The concept of uploading data sets and running a program for the users to input what they want to find, 
and for the results to be outputted is very interesting to me. Data sets with numeric variables will be important and necessary, but I am wondering if using data 
with categorical values will work in terms of finding the mean proportions for each value within each column. I want to explore the possibilies of using not just 
datasets with numeric variables, but categorical variables as well. I hope to use Python's built-in graphical output functions to print out the statistical graphs, 
but I also want to explore matplotlib as I have tiny experience using it. 

# Project Initial Work Plan (Milestones):

- Choose data files to use in the trinket. (CHECK)
- Work on gathering Runestone materials/chapters to review over, especially chapters with examples/exercises using data files.
- Gather functions for each summary statistic to use. 
- Brainstorm how to set up the structure of the program: CSV upload (CHECK), class declarations, def functions, for-loops, correct attribute & methods to use.
- Begin to code, but start light with foundational lines (CHECK). Make sure to get a thorough understanding of the structure of the program first. 
- Work out specific libraries I will need to load. 
- Do research in Runestone and online for concepts I don't remember. Ask many questions and go to office hours.
