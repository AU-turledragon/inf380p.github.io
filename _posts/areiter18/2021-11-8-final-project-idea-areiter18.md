title: Final Project Idea and Work Plan (so far)
---

For my final project, I would like to do something related to data analysis. I was thinking, because I am interested in working for the federal government and in international relations, of doing a project comparing government spending of the United States versus other countries.

If you follow the news, a constant pattern is US exasperation at defense spending amongst NATO member states. Essentially, many countries in NATO fail to meet the defense spending requirements stipulated in membership. I think it would be interesting to create a “.csv” file (or files) and compare defense spending in NATO countries. 

Essentially, the data I would utilize would be defense budgets for each country. I would hope to create a “.csv” file of each nation’s defense budget that would churn out the maximum amount of money a NATO member spends on defense, the minimum amount, the median amount, the range, and the mean amount. I think it would be interesting to create a pie chart that visualizes this data, as well. 

Second, I want to take another data set that provides the percentage of each member state’s budget (the current NATO requirement is 2%) and sort the countries into two lists: in compliance and outside of compliance. 

My challenge will be creating the “.csv” files for use so I will have to compile the data and cite where it is coming from. I am also unsure of how to fully complete my second goal of sorting data into two separate lists so I will need to some research on that.
