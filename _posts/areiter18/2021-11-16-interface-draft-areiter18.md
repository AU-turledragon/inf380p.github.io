<b>Here is my original plan: </b>
For my final project, I would like to do something related to data analysis. I was thinking, because I am interested in working for the federal government and in international relations, of doing a project comparing government spending of the United States versus other countries.

Essentially, the data I would utilize would be defense budgets for each country. I would hope to create a “.csv” file of each nation’s defense budget that would churn out the maximum amount of money a NATO member spends on defense, the minimum amount, the median amount, the range, and the mean amount. I think it would be interesting to create a pie chart that visualizes this data, as well.

Second, I want to take another data set that provides the percentage of each member state’s budget (the current NATO requirement is 2%) and sort the countries into two lists: in compliance and outside of compliance.

My challenge will be creating the “.csv” files for use so I will have to compile the data and cite where it is coming from. I am also unsure of how to fully complete my second goal of sorting data into two separate lists so I will need to some research on that.

<b>Here's what has changed and what I plan to do next: </b>

I found a .csv file on Kaggle that includes a breakdown of government budgets: revenues, expenditures, surplus/deficit, and surplus percentage of GDP. 
I have invested a lot of time in visualizing what I want this project to look like now. I have successfully converted the file into a dictionary (my goal for 11/14) and plan to add user input so that data can be pulled and revealed to the user based on what they inputted. I am still working through this and refreshing my knowledge on dictionaries, loops, and user inputs. I hope to have this section of the project completed by Sunday, November 21 (or, at least, I hope to have made progress on the user input section so that I have a workable draft). 

In addition, I completed a pie chart and a table for data visualization purposes. I am a huge fan of graphs and charts and find them very useful, so I knew I wanted to add some of these to my final project. I enjoyed learning how to make a pie chart, so I was pleased with the outcome of this. 

My biggest struggle, I think, is going to be the user interface and pulling data based on the user. I am currently struggling with this right now and have decided to take some time to review previous chapters in our textbook. I think this might be helpful. I still remain pretty nervous about the final project and how this will turn out. I am being patient with myself while trying to set deadlines. 

<b>As of now, my revised timeline looks as such:</b>

11/10/2021: Create table and pie chart for data visualization (complete, might add another graph based on time constraints)

11/12/2021: Meet with professor with questions regarding certain problems I am having (completed)

11/14/2021: Work on creating dictionary (complete) and work on write up 

11/15/2021-11/19/2021: Work on identifying questions and roadblocks; troubleshoot as needed; and work on smaller components of the project as time permits. 

By 11/21/2021: Have the user input section draft completed (or almost completed)

11/22/2021-11/24/2021: Work on next sections (help interface), add visualizations and options for user as needed. 

11/30/2021-12/5/2021: Finishing touches. What needs to be done? Make tweaks, updates, and edits where necessary. Write the reflection.

12/6/2021-12/8/2021: Final edits, edits on reflection, prepare to submit.
