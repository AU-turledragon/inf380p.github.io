title: Project Update (November 22)
---

I made a lot of progress with my code on Sunday, November 21 because I knew I’d be traveling for Thanksgiving. I was not expecting to complete as much as I did but I think I have a workable user interface that includes a help option, functions, and data that prints out for my user. 

Essentially, I have my code so that it prompts the user to get started with an example. I converted my data to a dictionary with each country having a number from 1-228. The user inputs a number, and it prints out that country’s data: revenue, expenditures, surplus (or deficit), and surplus/deficit as a percentage of GDP. 

Afterwards, I created a user interface that gives specific countries: users can select one of several options to learn about different places and how much they spend, etc. This section is also where I placed the “help” option should someone need it. I included a lot of text to help explain my code and my data. I think it was necessary given the amount of numbers involved. I also added lines to separate text for easier reading. 

My last section(currently) has a table and pie chart. I made these specifically so my users could visualize some of the data easily. In an ideal world, and if I had more experience, I would incorporate user input here so that my user could generate their own charts and graphs. Since I am feeling a bit ahead of schedule now, this might be something I try to learn to do. 

<b>What’s next:</b> I need to incorporate import custom modules into my code. I’d also like to create a section with user input to look at the max, min, mean, and median values for a particular column of data in my csv file. That will require some research so after the holiday I plan to focus on that. 

All in all, I am feeling a lot better about my project after my breakthroughs yesterday. I was not expecting to accomplish as much as I did. As an elementary coder, I think my project has a lot of room for improvement but it’s nice to know that there is a solid foundation to work off and edit in the coming weeks.

<b> Here is my code as Monday, November 22:</b>
