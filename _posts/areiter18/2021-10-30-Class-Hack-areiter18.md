I wanted to create something related to Halloween so I thought instantly of a jack-o-lantern. I wanted to experiment with different shapes, colors, placement, and text so this was the perfect way to try to work with these things. 

I first approached this code by customizing the defaults. For example, I changed the shape from "turtle" to "classic," which is a simple arrow just to see if I could do it. I also adjusted speed to "200." 

I thought it best to start off with the base. I used 2 circles and combined them together. For placement, it was mainly trial and error to see where I wanted them on the screen. I selected the "dark orange" color from the list because I thought it would look better than the standard orange. I used "goto" to move these shapes around and settled on a position towards the bottom of the screen. 

The three triangles were easy to create but difficult to place. I struggled with their placement for some time. Centering the pumpkin's nose was very difficult and the eyes remain a little oddly spaced but I ended up thinking it worked. 

The stem and mouth are both less typical shapes and I spent a lot of time trying to figure out to create these. I ended up going with an oddly shaped trapezoid for the stem and a half circle for the mouth. As mentioned above, placement was a struggle so I played around with different sizes and placement and eventually settled on a somewhat ideal place for these two components. I could have spent more time with the placement but I decided it was good enough for a first try and that it did the trick. 

When I first wrote the text "Happy Halloween!" I realized I forgot to hide the turtle so it made the text hard to read. I went back and tweaked this so that it would be easier to read and added .hideturtle() to my code. It looked much better afterwards. 

Overall, I approached this assignment in a less serious way than I usually do. I spent a lot of time playing around and not setting goals or outcomes. It was more enjoyable that way and I was pleased with the code.
