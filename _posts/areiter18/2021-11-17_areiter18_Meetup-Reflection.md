<b>Background:</b>

I attended an event titled “An Evening of Python Coding” in November 2021.  This event included demonstrations and was hosted by a group of programmers based out of Washington DC in collaboration with the local Python meetup in Austin. The person doing the demonstration was based out of Chicago, so the group had folks from across the US in the session. 

<b>How did it go and what did I learn?</b> 

At the start of the event, there was a short demo. I had taken the time to review the notes on GitHub. Since I am a new programmer, I am glad I reviewed the documents because I was able to follow along better with the prior knowledge. The demonstration involved “lightGBM.” I had no idea what this was prior to attending the meet-up and I could tell this was advanced material (this is for machine learning) based on my knowledge of Python. Nevertheless, I paid attention and appreciated the nature of the demo. I thought it was interesting that lightGBM was open source and derived from Microsoft research. It was neat to see someone working on a project outside of our course and wanting to share their genuine interest with others. After the demonstration, there was time for questions. I personally did not ask a question, but I found this nice that the whole group could reflect and ask the person conducting the demonstration any clarifying points. After attending, I believe that there’s so much to learn still in Python. This meetup also reinforced my desire to keep practicing coding.  In my research position at the Texas Digital Library, one of my colleagues reminded me that you need to keep practicing Python even after class to retain knowledge. That is something I want to do since I could be in a profession where Python is useful in the future. Because of the demonstration’s complexity, I did not learn much per say but I did leave with a commitment to keep up with Python even after this course ends. 

<b>How was the experience different from your expectations?</b>

Since I joined the session early, I had time to get some background from the group’s convenor. He mentioned that prior to COVID-19 there were far more opportunities for group work after the demo. He acknowledged that it is more difficult with COVID, which is very similar to what other organizations and classes are facing during the pandemic. I was pleased with the group’s informality and friendliness. I think when you’re new to a group you have a lot of assumptions about how it is going to be run. I was expecting a much more regimented and quiet evening and, instead, it was very collaborative and friendly. The invitation made it clear that folks at all levels of Python understanding were welcome and that made me willing to give this a try. There were job opening and conference announcements, too, which was nice for those who might be searching for employment or opportunities. Overall, the entire mood of the evening was different than I predicted. The chat during the demonstration was very lively and there were a lot of questions, words of encouragement, and points being made. In short, this was an engaged group. I enjoyed the level of interest folks seemed to have. That is, they wanted to be there to share and collaborate. 

<b>Could you see yourself becoming a member of a professional community like this in the future?</b>

I think I could see myself joining a group such as this one in the future. I still don’t know what I want to do but I feel myself gravitating towards the digital side of libraries and archives, so I assume Python is a skill I want to keep working on. Meetups, such as this one, might allow me to continue to develop my skills in Python.
