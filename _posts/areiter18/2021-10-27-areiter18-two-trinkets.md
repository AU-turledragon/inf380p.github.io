After doing the assignment on Turtles, I found myself enjoying getting to be a little creative with programming. However, like many of our other chapters, I found the different requirements and terms to be a bit confusing. Since I did the Chapter 17 work on a different day than my trinket work, I decided to begin developing my own design by reviewing the terms discussed in the chapter. I found this to be helpful for many reasons: I was able to get some review in, which is critical for coding, and I was able to avoid any initial major struggles when developing my own piece of code using turtles. 
    I was experimenting with turtles, in general, so I wanted to give myself time to troubleshoot and figure out how to approach this assignment. I settled on a shape that would repeat itself 12 times and that I felt would create a nice pattern. I knew I wanted to experiment with color and fill color, but I first decided to develop my code and come back to those customizable aspects. Overall, in hindsight, this was a good decision because I was able to work on aspects of coding that I was more familiar with and then return to less familiar things (i.e. color) later. Since I had made the decision to review terms prior to starting, my code started off without a hitch until I got to line 10: 
  andrew.foward(150)
At the time, I couldn’t figure out what was wrong instantly. However, a quick closer look, with glasses on, revealed I had spelled “forward” incorrectly, which was an easy fix. Once I solved this issue, the code worked but it was a good reminder to check spelling always before assuming there is something else wrong with your code. 
    After that, I decided to experiment with adding color. Adding a line of code called andrew.color('red’) was quite easy but I struggled with fill color. Initially, I had added only the following line and I didn’t notice any difference:andrew.fillcolor(‘orange’)
Because of this, I went back to the material and realized I had forgotten to add the begin_fill() and end_fill() statements. I tweaked my code, so it looked like the following and it worked exactly the way I wanted it to.

Overall, my experience with Turtles was positive. I was pleased with my decision to review material prior to starting, which I felt helped this process. My next goal with this chapter is to experiment with several different shapes in one code, utilizing different colors and line size.
