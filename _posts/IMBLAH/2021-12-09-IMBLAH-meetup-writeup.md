For the meetup assignment, I actually had three different experiences. Each of them was "PyLadies Tech & Coding Night" on November 15, "Let's contribute to pandas - no prior experience required!" on November 19, and "Developing Custom Components in Grasshopper with Python" on November 20.

# PyLadies Tech & Coding Night by PyLadies ATX
This should have been a virtual event that happened Nov. 15, but unfortunately it didn't happen as expected. So, I didn't learn anything about so-called knowledge. However, it did remind me that this was an event that was spontaneously organized and that it could be cancelled without notification. It was a complicated feeling. I was a little upset because it was canceled without a sign. I was also grateful for the hosts doing something that could contribute to the technical community without expecting any rewards even though they all have a busy life.

# Let's contribute to pandas - no prior experience required! by PyLadies London
Since the first one didn't happen as expected, I attended this one held by PyLadies London. In the description of the event, it says that I'll be mentored through setting up a development environment and making a contribution to pandas. "No prior experience required" attracted me, with no doubt, since I know nothing about pandas. 
Actually, this was a good but not perfect experience due to some technical issues.
For the good part, since the event is designed for people with any background, to keep track of each attendee’s path, the host shared a link to a sheet that could be edited by anyone. It listed all the tasks we need to do in order. We could tell the host where we are by adding a checkmark under each task. I think this was a super brilliant strategy. Since I don’t like to ask questions when I get stuck, the host would ask me if I needed help when there was no progress shown in the sheet. Also, there are people that have attended this meetup before. Since they didn’t need to do the initial setup, they also offered help if others needed help. I really enjoy this kind of environment.
In terms of the part that’s not so perfect, firstly, because of the time difference, I needed to wake up at 4 in the morning to attend the event. Second, I was still frustrated because I didn’t know anything about pandas and some of the terminology in the technical community. Third, I needed to do things in different windows in the browser - a meeting screen, a Google Sheet, etc. - and in the Terminal. My laptop was getting pretty slow and could do nothing. I left the meeting earlier than planned because of this issue.

# Developing Custom Components in Grasshopper with Python by DigitalFUTURES
I found this one held by DigitalFUTURES right after I finished the second one. Instead of attending a walkthrough-based workshop, I tried to do something different like a lecture-based meetup, where I could just focus on the content and also reduce the workload of my laptop. 
In this session, the instructor gave a lecture about how to use Python to automate some repetitive tasks or perform some tasks in rhino or grasshopper that we do not have access to in the standard setup commands for rhino or grasshopper components.
This time, the experience got better because of both the form of the session and my prior knowledge of python. I could focus not only on the knowledge the instructor was spreading but also on other things. 
As for the knowledge part, I learned some basic things about rhino and learned how to draw some complex models using rhino. The purpose of developing custom components in grasshopper with python is that when we want to do some generative design through using algorithms and we don’t want to limit ourselves to a grasshopper, we can use python in rhino to create custom components or custom commands or to create new plugins and components etc. The instructor said, “if you are creative enough, you will have no limit in using python”, which was really impressive.
Apart from this, I noticed something else. The instructor is not a non-native English speaker, which is similar to my identity. I used to be unconfident in expressing myself in English. However, after witnessing how he made this the wonderful speech, I realized that language is just a tool for expressing knowledge. If the knowledge can be spread correctly, it’s not a big deal to make some grammar mistakes.

# Conclusion
This is the whole troubleshooting process like what I do when coding. I learned a lot not only about knowledge but also about the inclusive culture in this community. I really enjoyed this kind of vibe and will keep attending meetups. Also, as a non-native speaker and a woman, a so-called minority in this field, I hope I can speak up to make my experience resonate with others and spread this kind of culture in the future.
