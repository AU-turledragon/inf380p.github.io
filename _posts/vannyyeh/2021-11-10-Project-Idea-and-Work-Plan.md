title: "Vanny's Final Project Idea and Work Plan"
---
updated: after the class group discusssion

Type of final project: text-based data analysis <br />
Topic: Weather Fetching Application


Idea: To fetch the weather and air quality of the past five months of history 
and the next 5 days by the current location.


Work Plan: <br />
(1) Fetching the IP of the user (If the Ip is wrong then will ask the user's zip code) <br />
 --> Will utailize `for` loop, `while` loop and dict <br />
(2) Pulling the weather data from ("https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-data") for a CSV data <br />
(3) Display the result on panel <br />
 --> Include the current temp, forcasting temp, air quality and humidity, etc <br />
(4) Adding help and exit function for this app <br />



Inspiration: According to the class, I've learn so many useful concept and function like running the data until it reach the max.
I am thinkging to use the `dict{}` method to save and pull my data. Nevertheless, I want to turn those methods into a functional 
and practical application that I can see what I've made as my python learning capstone. 
I am interested in weather forcasting and compare the real time weather with the history data for people to think about the enviornment
and what human can improve to help the Earth. Therefore, the weather fetching panel will provide a platform with an instinctive and 
straightforward control platform. 

Extra: 
1. Real time weather data
2. Making it into an App or a Web. <br />
