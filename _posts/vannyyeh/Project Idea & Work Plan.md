Type of final project: text-based data analysis
Topic: Weather Fetching Application

----

Idea: To fetch the weather and air quality in the next 5 days by the current location.


Work Plan:
(1) Fetching the IP of the user (If the Ip is wrong then will ask the user's zip code)
 --> Will utailize `for` loop, `while` loop and dict
(2) Pulling the weather data from google or website ("https://www.worldweatheronline.com/")
(3) Display the result on panel
 --> Include the current temp, forcasting temp, air quality and humidity, etc
(4) Adding help and exit function for this app

Extra: Hopefully can make it to an App or a Web.
