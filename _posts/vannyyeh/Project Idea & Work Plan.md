Type of final project: text-based data analysis <br />
Topic: Weather Fetching Application

---

Idea: To fetch the weather and air quality in the next 5 days by the current location.


Work Plan:
(1) Fetching the IP of the user (If the Ip is wrong then will ask the user's zip code) <br />
 --> Will utailize `for` loop, `while` loop and dict <br />
(2) Pulling the weather data from google or website ("https://www.worldweatheronline.com/") <br />
(3) Display the result on panel <br />
 --> Include the current temp, forcasting temp, air quality and humidity, etc <br />
(4) Adding help and exit function for this app <br />

Extra: Hopefully can make it to an App or a Web. <br />

Inspiration: According to the class, I've learn so many useful concept and function like running the data until it reach the max. 
Therefore, I want to turn those methods into a functional and practical application that I can see what I've made as my python 
learning capstone.
