# Reflection

This exercise in Runestone contains many structures and loops. In the middle of the semester, while I read the codes, I lost in the lines because there were so many structures. But after I did my final project and came back again, those codes and logic made more sense to me (although I still need to read it for a few mins). Coincidently, the ideas and the loop's reason are the same as my final project in the historical data parts. 

The first part of this exercise is reading the file and creating the dictionary to map each word and count the times it appears. Those codes remind me of some built-in function codes in python that are not as common as others, but it's helpful when it needs. For example, instead of simply printing out counts, I learned that it could construct a list of tuples and then sort the list in reverse order. Therefore, I will be able to adjust the outputs to look like what I want for the word frequency analysis.
