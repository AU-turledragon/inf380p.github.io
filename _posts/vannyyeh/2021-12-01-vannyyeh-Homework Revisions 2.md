# Reflection

I can't see the point of learning regular expression at the beginning. Therefore, I wasn't able to memorize and understand the concept of using it at the beginning. 
Same as revision 1, after doing the final project, I realize the concept of having regular expression is helpful, especially doing the web scraping. 

For example:
The regular expression `F..m`: can match any of the strings "From:," "Fxxm:," "F12m:", or "F!@m:"

It is true that regular expression is a little complicated and because regular expressions have their own little language unto themselves, like the orders of the alphabet. They start with a lowercase letter, an uppercase letter, then the number(`[a-zA-Z0-9]`). Therefore, the exercise I showed in the trinket mess my brain at the beginning of the order and did not leave a space. I kept getting the errors until I realized that I would need to switch to its rule and logic to implement its function now. I pick this as one of my revisions is because I felt pretty important that the regular expression could be after I almost finish the class. Even though the rules and the syntax is hard to memorize about how to use, I believe I will use them a lot in my future career.
