# Reflection:
It was challenging while I started trying to draw an image of my dog - schnauzer. 
While I was setting up the init def in the class, the input in the () confused me since it has been a while I haven't used that in class. But I realized 
that it was just the initial start. However, I am still confused about the speed() I set it up at first which I think it has been changed afterward (but 
I didn't set it up below)
```
class schnauzer_element(turtle.Turtle):
  def __init__(self):
    turtle.Turtle.__init__(self)
    self.speed(500)
```
Also, it's pretty challenging, while the outline needs to be very complicated. I am thinking of calling the function twice, so I don't need to code every 
single one. I am using the eyes twice, but I think if I can put the variable of the location. I went back runstone and look carefully and it really helps.
`def dog_righteyes(x,y)`

Overall, the practice was really good and I hope that I would have more chances to implement more functions to my turtle drawing.
