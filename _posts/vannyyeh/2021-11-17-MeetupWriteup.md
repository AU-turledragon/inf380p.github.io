I participated in 3 different Meetups online. Each of them was “Women in code lighting learning” on Nov 1st, “Coding for Beginners: Intro to HTML & CSS workshop” on Nov 4th, and “Introduction to JavaScript” on Nov 11th.

Before all the meetups, I wasn’t excited about it because I was pre-conditioning an informal but boring section that was just held online. However, I was wrong. Even though I have my preferences, they are still all interested and helpful after joining three meetups.

The first meetup - Women in code lighting learning. 
---
As stated, it’s for women who are in the tech industry. I was expecting that learning code skills in this meetup with more soft teachings, yet it’s a light talk about women in the industry. Coincidence, what we talked about meetup matched with the cultural immersion reading brought me more ideas about that. 
It was inspiring that they mentioned that some of them worked in restaurants and health care, which is literally not related to programming. They also talked about why they jumped into this field and how to find a job by switching from previous jobs. The most important thing they brought out to the table is the difference between their old job and programming job. The people who worked with health care mentioned that she used to deal with people emotionally while the software does not require that, but communication can still be a key in the tech industry. Therefore, taking advantage of being female like people skills, being extrovert can be beneficial. There are some disadvantages of being female in the industry that I’ve already covered in the diversity reflection, and there are still many pros can cons. Nevertheless, the tech is not the kind of toxic environment that women have to leave.

Besides, I learned the tech environment for females itself, but I also learned some must-know for real industry world like salary, how to deal with hr. and how to get an offer letter from big tech. The speaker in this meet-up was generous to share her salary and teach us the tips to negotiate with hr. After the meet-up, I can see myself becoming a member of this community in the future, even though I know I still have a lot of room for improvement in coding. But just like the speaker said, without coding, everyone has its strength, and it can be an advantage.

The second meetup - Coding for Beginners: Intro to HTML & CSS workshop. 
---
This workshop is what I am looking for. This is an actual workshop for coding. It taught the basic knowledge of HTML, like adding headers and body for HTML and CSS. This meetup was not as spiritual as the last one, but it gave me an excellent chance to learn front-end coding, and the speaker mentioned that the white spaces do not matter but matter in Python, which is useful for me as a Python learner.

---
The third meetup - Introduction to JavaScript. 
---
This is a JS workshop held by a Bootcamp called Temple, and it’s my favorite meetup during this period because it’s an active meetup, I got the chance to really join the meeting, and the speaker checked my code while I had a bug. The group was not significant, there’s only four people included the speaker. We got to know each other and their background. It’s a good networking opportunity.
The speaker is named Mike, and he is an engineer in Chicago. Before diving deep into the actual coding, he brought up the programming definition and history of JavaScript (May 1995 by Brendan Rich) and analyzed it. After his explanation, I learned that JS performs computations, communicates with files, and displays windows. HTML is rendered elements on the web page(markup) when CSS is style sheet language(rules), and JS is the behavior. Therefore, JS can create a UI framework and Single Page Apps. During coding practice, he suggests we use “Visual Studio Code” as the IDE. We covered the reason for using the function, DOM (Document Object Model), Function creation, and function called. There’s a fun fact from this meet-up is I just realized that JS is not related to JAVA. It’s just a coincidental name.

Conclution

"Programming is know how to Google".

After attending all the meetups, I believe I will attend more in the future. I hope I can share my coding notes in this reflection. Those experiences brought me more valued knowledge than I expected. It’s helpful not only for hard coding skills but also soft care like interacting with company HR while I really want to get the offer, etc. Networking is another good gain while attending meetups. I got some chances to know people, especially during the last meetup I had, and I got to add their LinkedIn. I felt supported, and I have a clearer picture of what I want to be in this professional community - a front-end engineer.
