Reflection
---
I really like the built-in functions of lists in Python. In this exercise I just looped through each line of the text, checked if the word exists in a list of words that I defined at the begining,
and if that word doesn't exist in the list, I will append that word to the list. In this way only unique words can be appended to the list. After this, I did a quick search on Google
to see if there is a built-in sort function for lists and found it. It was a very straight-forward practice.
