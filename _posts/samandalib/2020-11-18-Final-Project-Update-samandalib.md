## Project Update
I gathered data from a web API. Then I stored the data in a CSV format and saved it on my computer. Then I read the data based on user input and converted it to a dictionary type. I plan to get a graph from my data and as I read documentations, it is best to have either a numpy array or a pandas dataframe to be able to get a good graph. So I wrote the code to convert dictionary to pandas dataframe. Currently my challenge is in cleaning my data in order to be able to get a graph using matplotlib library.
