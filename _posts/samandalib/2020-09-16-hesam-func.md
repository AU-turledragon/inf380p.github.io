I want to draw a cube multiple times. I wrote the code for one and turned it into a function to be able to call the functione everytime I want. I called it once, changed the position of 
the pen and tried to draw another one. However, the position of the second cube is not what I expected and I couldn't figure out how to fix it. I know I need to reset the rotation of the 
turtle everytime but I couldn't.
