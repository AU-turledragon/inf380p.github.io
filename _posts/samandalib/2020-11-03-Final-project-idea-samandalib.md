title: "Idea for my final project"
---

For the final project, I am thinking of making a program that uses stock market datasets to analyze the correlation of companies stock prices with each other. For example, consider
we want to see how changes in the stock price of Amazon within the last 10 year have affected the stock price of 10 other companies. The result of this program can be used in analyzing
the interconnectivity of companies in the market and how they affect each other.
For implementing this idea, I am thinking of the following milestones:
- [ ] Finding appropriate datasets that I can get data from
- [ ] Cleaning up data as necessary
- [ ] Learning and using Numpy, Panda and Matplotlib for analyzing
- [ ] Write the code to use data for analyzing using data science libraries
- [ ] Visualizing the output with Matplotlib

Also as a stretch goal, I am considering using a REST API to keep the data updated whenever the user wants to try it.
