# Project Ideas
For my final project, I think I’m going to take inspiration from an earlier project, my turtle hack project. In that exercise, I had the user go through a sort of choose your own adventure. If you made the correct choices, you would help Tina the Turtle survive, lay some eggs, and then swim off into the sunset. I had a lot of fun with that code and I think that I will want to consistently work on something that is fun! That is all my covid/end-of-the-year brain can handle. For my first level, I think I might have the user move the turtle through the ocean, avoiding barriers (maybe a shark or a net?). When the user makes it to the other side of the screen, they win the first level. Maybe my next round, I might have the user try to lay eggs while avoiding incoming birds. Or I might break this up into two rounds. Maybe go through a sand maze to lay eggs and avoid birds as you make your way off the beach. I’m still mulling this over and want to see what I’m capable of in the first level. 

## Initial Milestones
- [ ] Create first level
- [ ] Set the ocean scene
- [ ] Create turtle
- [ ] Allow user to name turtle
- [ ] Allow user to move turtle with arrow keys
- [ ] Create barriers
- [ ] Let the user know if they have won a round
- [ ] Move user onto the next level
- [ ] Set the beach scene
- [ ] Finalize next levels
- [ ] Create birds
- [ ] If user looses, exit game 
- [ ] Create final you win!
