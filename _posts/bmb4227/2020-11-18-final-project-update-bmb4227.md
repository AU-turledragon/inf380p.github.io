# Reflection
I made some of the progress that I planned too last week including getting everything moved over to Python, getting a good start on level on, converting my images. I was having a bit of trouble figuring out how I would pause my game without losing track of where we are in the game I am but might have found a good resource here:https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html So far I've been using a dictionary to keep track of images and to just make it a bit easier on myself. 

## Code I have been working on

## In Class Updated Milestones
- [x] Move current work to Pygame
- [x] Convert images to gifs
- [ ] Create a welcome title page
- [ ] Move on to 1st level when the player presses a key
- [ ] Add a help button image 
- [ ] When help image is clicked, pause game
- [ ] Wehn help image is clicked show new screen with instruction about how to navigate through each level (wonder if I should have unique instructions for each level)
- [ ] Stay on help screen until user exits
- [ ] Create first level
  - [x] Set the ocean scene background
  - [x] set screen size-will use same screen size for each level
  - [x] Create turtle character
  - [x] Allow user to move turtle with arrow keys
  - [ ] Set boundary for turtle within window
  - [ ] Add other predators- birds and sharks
  - [ ] Make predators move through the scene-staggered and maybe getting faster as level progresses
  - [ ] If user hits predators- maybe a couple?- lose round
  - [ ] If user avoids x number of predators- they win! And move onto next level
- [ ] Create second level
  - [ ] Add jellyfish and plastic bags
  - [ ] Make jellyfish and plastic bags move through water-staggered
  - [ ] Make jellyfish and plastic bags alternate between blue circle and their image
  - [ ] Keep track of how many of each the player gets
  - [ ] If the player gets too many bags-they lose.
  - [ ]  If a player catches enough jellyfish.. show scene of going onto beach and move to third level
- [ ]  Decide what third level is 
- [ ] Create final you win!
- [ ] Ask user if they want to play again
