For the most part, things are making sense to me. It just feels like I need a lot of practice and everything is very trial and error for me at this point. I appreciate your note in the why python reading that you will give less precise information but more useful. I think that that is useful to the way I learn personally. I’m ok not knowing everything up front because it overwhelms me. When I understand the basics of smaller pieces it makes understanding the whole more easily. I really enjoyed the variables exercises. It felt a lot like doing a puzzle which I really like. The most difficult part for me was figuring out the second problem, multiplying the hours and the rate to get the pay. I did not realize at first that in the problem I needed to multiply int(hours) by int(rate). In an example in Ch. 2 Variables you had put:
>>> prompt = 'What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\n'
>>> speed = input(prompt)
What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
17
>>> int(speed)
17
>>> int(speed) + 5
22
My question is, do I need to put that first int(speed) or can I skip ahead to the equation and just write int(speed) + 5?

This does not have a lot to do with the course, but one of my biggest frustrations this week was the O’Reily website. I enrolled in the trial and tried to watch the first chapter. I could not find any of the materials associated with the course to download and there was no rewind function on the video? I probably completely missed it but I probably spent 30 minutes trying to rewind a few seconds because I missed something and could not figure out how to do it. When I am watching a video and trying to learn a new skill, an easy rewind function is very important because it often takes me multiple times to understand a concept.  I finally just went to Udemy which was much more me-friendly, and straight forward.
