Reflection:
For my logical turtle exercise, I decided to have a person guess the number that tina the turtle was thinking of and then win a house. They could then choose the type of weather surrounding their home (cloudy or sunny). Depending on what they decided, the sky would turn grey or blue. The cloudy option produced a whole bunch of turtles-raining turtles. I think to improve my statement, I could have had a try and except conditional and then placed the rest of the code to build the house and environment within it. However, Wednesdays, I have all of my courses, so I didn’t have time to change this before my submission, and like someone else pointed out, I overthink things and spend too much of the 15 minutes not actually accomplishing anything, so that is something I need to work on.
Questions: Is there a trick to highlighting and moving everything over by one indent? Or can you only remove the indentation all at once? I’m still a little bit confused about how you know when you should use if/else statements vs. when you should use the try and except. I think… you use the try and except when you want the code things to stop? Because, for example, in my logical turtle even though my error message would occur when the wrong input option was entered if there was another print or input statement that occurred after that, it would continue on.
