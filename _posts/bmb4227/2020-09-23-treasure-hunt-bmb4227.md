# Reflection
This week I think I made the mistake of trying to complete almost everything on one day. At first, I tried to incorporate the click feature but wasn't able to and got super frustrated with it, gave up and tried to figure out the very basics. Figuring out the logic behind the getting warmer or colder feature was a bit difficult and I at first used an "or" where I should have used an "and." Looking at my code now compared to the other day when I worked on it has already become clearer where I was making some mistkes so I think I will go back and try to edit it after class.
