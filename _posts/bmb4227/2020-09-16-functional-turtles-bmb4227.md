# *Reflection:*
In this week's homework I don't think I fully understood functionals and when something went into the brackets and when it didn't. After today's class, I think I finally got that, the variable that changes goes in the (), like the color in my example below. I thought I understood what have try and except meant but after absorbing and thinking about it, I think I am a little bit confused. Sometimes it is difficult to only hear an auditory explanation and I need to read it so I might try and do a little bit of research on my own. 

In this code I defined a function to draw a house shape which is something I use a couple of times throughout the rest of the code.
