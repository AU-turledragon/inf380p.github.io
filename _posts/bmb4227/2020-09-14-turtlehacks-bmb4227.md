**Reflection**
This week for my turtle hack assignment I decided to make a little choose your own adventure which would determine whether or not Tina the turtle survived her day on the beach. If the user made the wrong choice then Tina would sadly die. If the user makes all of the right choices Tina will survive a bird attack, lay some eggs, have a meal, and make it back out to the ocean at sunset. The correct answers are yes, hide, jellyfish. This week as I moved through my program I realized how many layers there could be-an if statement within an if statement within an if statement. It seems like it might get tricky to keep track of things and was wondering if people just use the comments for this or are there other tricks? I also came across an issue where I would define something in one layer ( I don’t think this is the right term for this?) and then try to use that definition one layer out but it wouldn’t be recognized. It made me realize that I may want keep a sort of dictionary at the top of, for example, functions that I think I may want to use within multiple layers rather than defining them multiple times. Working longer on one turtle assignment really helped me to get a handle of the language. I could finally execute commands without having to look them all up by the end so I felt good about this assignment and I think this will be helpful for me with in class assignemtns.
