title: "Claire and Brittany's Dictionary Pair Exercise!"
---
# Reflection
Brittany: It was really great wroking with Claire. I knew how to say that the state was represented in the 6th line and I knew that needed to go into our dictionary but I didn't know how to execute it but Claire did! and then I knew how to alphebatize the list. I think we were both unfortunately, very confused by the fourth section of the code. Building a dictionary inside a dictionary is still confusing for me.

Claire: While working together during the class, Brittany and I helped each other to solve the questions and problems, and I think this definetly makes us work more efficiently. Out of class, we took turns to finish our assignment and exchanged ideas through email. Although we might not be able to collaborate in person, we still figure our way to cooperate virtually!
