title: "Claire and Brittany's Dictionary Pair Exercise!"

# Reflection
Brittany:It was really great wroking with Claire. I knew how to say that the state was represented in the 6th line and I knew that needed to go into our dictionary but I didn't know how to execute it but Claire did! and then I knew how to alphebatize the list. I think we were both unfortunately, very confused by the fourth section of the code. Building a dictionary inside a dictionary is still confusing for me.
