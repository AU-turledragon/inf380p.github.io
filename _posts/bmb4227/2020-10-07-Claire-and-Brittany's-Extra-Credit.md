# Reflection

For our pair project, Claire and I spent a lot of time on the first exercise. At first we wrote it in a way that each line was organized into an individual list but Claire did a great job of figuring that issue out. Our final list still organizes capitalized words first before lower cased letters so that might be something that we need to fix and figure out in the future.
