# Reflection
I am feeling pretty good about my game and excited about it! This week I worked on creating a help button and putting together some initial pieces of the start screen and help button. I didn’t realize at first that our game had to be in Pygame. When I tried to transfer what I had worked on I ran into a few issues using both Pygame. Every time I tried to use Pygame it said it was connecting and then disconnected so I am hoping to figure that out in this class. I think this might have something to do with including a while statement. I had some smaller initial issues figuring out if I could use \n with my turtle.write() function which I still haven’t quite figured out if I can do or not. I think my milestones are realistic. I think figuring out the first level will be the most difficult, but I will be able to reuse a lot of my code from the first level in my second level with just a few modifications. I had a lot of fun finding graphics to possibly use in my game and used mainly OpenGameArt.org and PNGTree.  My work this week aligned pretty much with my initial ideas and plans but just a bit more detailed. I have since made some more solid plans for my first two levels. 
1st level- Avoid the predators. Player will be able to move their turtle up and down through ocean and sky(this turtle is a good jumper) and will have to try and avoid collision with seagulls, sharks, and maybe nets
2nd level- Get some food. Players will again be able to move back and forth and will try to run into jellyfish (their food). There will be both jellyfish and plastic bags floating through the ocean, but they will be flashing between what they are and a blue circle to make it a bit more difficult. 
3rd level- I’m still trying to figure this one out but I think it will be set on the beach and have something to do with laying eggs.

Before next week I would like to get my Pygame or Python3 issues figured out, I  would like to complete my start screen, and mostly completed my first level (set scene, and figure out how to get predators moving through the screen, and set boundaries for turtle).

## Updated Milestones
- [ ] Create a welcome title page
- [ ] Move on to 1st level when the player presses a key
- [ ] Create a help button with instruction about how to navigate through each layer
- [ ] Create first level
- [ ] Set the ocean scene
- [ ] Create turtle
- [ ] Allow user to move turtle with arrow keys
- [ ] Set boundary for turtle within window
- [ ] Add other predators- birds and sharks
- [ ] Make predators move through the scene-staggered
- [ ] If user hits predators- maybe a couple?- lose round
- [ ] If user avoids x number of predators- they win! And move onto next level
- [ ] Create second level
- [ ] Add jellyfish and plastic bags
- [ ] Make jellyfish and plastic bags move through water-staggered
- [ ] Make jellyfish and plastic bags alternate between blue circle and their image
- [ ]  Keep track of how many of each the player gets
- [ ] If the player gets too many bags-they lose.
- [ ]  If a player catches enough jellyfish.. show scene of going onto beach and move to third level
- [ ]  Decide what third level is 
- [ ] Create final you win!
