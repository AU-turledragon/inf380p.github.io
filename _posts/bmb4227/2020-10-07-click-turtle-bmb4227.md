# Reflection
For this week's assignment I went ahead in the videos and learned how to filter through a list of pen colors so that the user could change colors, I also defined a couple of shapes (hexagon and circle) and provided key commands for those, I added dragging capabilities, and added the ability to change the screen background. I wanted to create a similar list for the background to filter through but I kept getting errors. I think that I need to explore more deeply what init and self mean. I also attempted to include user input in the background but it just printed out my input sentence over and over again. I am pretty sure I have had this error before and have fixed it but I just need to think about it more and maybe try and go back and fix it...I might be able to do something with a loop.
