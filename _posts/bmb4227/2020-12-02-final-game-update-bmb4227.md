title: "Brittany's Final Game Update!"
---

I did not get a lot done this week just because all of my other final essays and projects were due December 2nd but now, I am excited to get back to my project. While I didn’t get a lot of actual coding done, I was able to do a bit more planning. For example, I watched the Udemy videos on custom turtle classes and have figured out how I am going to use that to create multiple predators or jellyfish with the same attributes and behaviors. I have also finally figured out how my help button will work. If a player clicks the button, the moving game pieces will pause, the player and predators will hide, and text (or maybe an image) will appear. Again, I think I can create use class to hide my turtles but I have also been experimenting with turtle.Turtles after our talk in the previous class. However, I was having some trouble, after using turtle.Turtles() then adding text to the page after the other turtles were hidden. When the player hits the help button again, the game will resume. I have a lot of trinkets with tests and small pieces of my program, but I think I need to focus on bringing these elements together in a logical way. As a way to force accountability, I have set up an office hour appointment on Monday so that I have plenty of time to talk about any roadblocks I am experiencing and fix them by Friday December 11. 

## Updated Milestones
- [ ] Create a welcome title page
- [ ] Display level on all screens but welcome
- [ ] Display health/lives on all level screens
- [ ] Move on to 1st level when the player presses a key
- [ ] Create a help button with instruction about how to navigate through each layer
- [x] Create pause function
- [ ] When player hits pause button or help button, pause
- [ ] Create first level
- [ ] Add jellyfish and plastic bags
- [ ] Make jellyfish and plastic bags move through water-staggered
- [ ] Make jellyfish and plastic bags alternate between blue circle and their image
- [ ]  Keep track of how many of each the player gets
- [ ] If the player gets too many bags-they lose.
- [ ]  If a player catches enough jellyfish.. show scene of going onto beach and move to third

- [x] Set the ocean scene
- [x] Create turtle
- [x] Allow user to move turtle with arrow keys
- [ ] Set boundary for turtle within window
- [ ] Add other predators- birds and sharks
- [x] Make predators move through the scene-staggered
- [ ] If user hits predators- maybe a couple?- lose round
- [x] If user hits predator, send predator back
