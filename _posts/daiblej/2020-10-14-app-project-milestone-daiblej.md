I decide to do the blackjack project, as currently, I am addicted in this poker game. It will be super interesting if I can write it in Python by myself.


## milestones:
- [x]  understand the blackjack rules

- [ ]  deal two cards to the dealer
- [ ]  deal two cards to the player
- [ ]  for the dealer, hide one card and show one card
- [ ]  for the player, show two cards
- [ ]  Q1: ask the player whether he/she wants to hit/stand/(split)
- [ ]  if over 21, then show bust
- [ ]  if equal to 21, then show congratulation
- [ ]  if less then 21, then go to Q1
- [ ]  if stand, then show the dealer's cards
- [ ]  compare the result and show the winner
- [ ]  ask whether play again
- [ ]  determine whether go for more details: 
        1)A = 1 or 11 ?
        2)if the dealer's card less than 17, give another card & loop until more than 17 
        3)split
        4)select from 52 cards
