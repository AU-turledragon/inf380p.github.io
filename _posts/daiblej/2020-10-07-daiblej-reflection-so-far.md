title: "Janet's class reflection so far"
---

I combined my reflection on the class so far with the extra credit reflection together. But I noticed it's independent homework. So I decided to rewrite it.

It's a very challenging class. I don't feel I am good at coding and sometimes the complicated executions and glossaries make me afraid more. However, every time I figure out a problem by myself, I feel super excited. I also learned a lot from pair programming. I know how to write add in a shorter way:
```Python
count = count + 1
count += 1
```
Another example that I learned from pair programming:
```Python
print("There were",count, "lines in the file with From as the first word")
print("There were "+ str(count) +" lines in the file witn Form as the first word")
```
They are not that difficult, but these are the moments when the lightbulbs came to me.

However, there is still a lot of time that I can't find the answer from the textbook. I have to use stack overflow and other online forums. But I sometimes think it's hard to describe my problem.

This is a quite difficult exercise for me. To be honest, I didn't reach my ideal goal. I don't know how to `def` a function and separate into different files to make the code clearer.
I also find it's hard to understand all kinds of errors but I can't find a specific example now. 
There are many methods can be used in the list but the problem is I can't remember all, especially when I need them. For example:
```Python
    t.append(x)
    t = t + [x]
```
```Python
    t.append([x])          # WRONG!
    t = t.append(x)        # WRONG!
    t + [x]                # WRONG!
    t = t + x              # WRONG!
```
Like what I mentioned earlier, these are some errors that I am hard to notice immediately.
You might find I am not good at describing the problems. Maybe because there are too many glossaries but I think it's more related to my poor English. 
I hope this situation can become better at the end of the class. This is also the goal I set for myself: knowing how to effectively look for help online.XD

For strategy, I now know it's good to set up several milestones before we start a big project. But I don't know how to distribute tasks evenly. That's something I will practice in future exercises.

Learning programming is not easy but thanks for the professor and my classmates, I am now confident to step into the code world.
