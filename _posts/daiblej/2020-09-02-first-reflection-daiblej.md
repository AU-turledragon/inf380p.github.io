title:"Janet's first class reflection"
---

Actually, I didn't take the first class so I am afraid that I can't catch up with others. I have a lot of concerns before class. Elliot will know that because I send him so many questions through emails. I also asked my friends who are good at coding. They told me Python is not a difficult language. Writing Python is just like writing English. The first reading material also mentions this. However, I am an international student so even writing English can be a big challenge for me. But it shouldn't be an excuse. " We choose to go to the moon not because it's easy, but because it's difficult, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept." No matter what, I start my coding journey now.

Glad Elliot recorded the first class which allows me to have a great understanding of our first-class missions. It's super helpful. I finish the first coding assignment quickly with the tutorials. However, there is still a lot of things I can't quite understand in Github. I tried to upload my first post into our community and tried twice but it didn't show up in the _posts file. I guess I might need permission but I still want to know more about how Github works.

Python language really looks like our daily language. It seems to give users a more flexible space but there are still many restrictions inside which I need to learn more in future classes. I don't think my answers to the assignments are the best solutions and I'm wondering is there any good solutions to show str, int, float in one line. I'm glad Python doesn't need ';' to seperate lines but I want to know more rules about 'blankspace'? Oh, back to the in-class exercise, how can we draw curves? And usually, do designers use Python to draw as it seems really time-consuming. Is there any software can help engineer to tranform visual design to codes? These might be all the questions I have after the first class.
