**My final project idea**
~~I'm not sure what I can do based on the knowledge I learned in this class. Now I have two plans.
The first one is keeping working on blackjack game. I really love this game and think there are a lot that I can improve. I'm also thinking import turtle in the game to draw the cards and chips. If so, the game will be more vivid.
[ ] Add GUI where turtle can draw the cards
[ ] Think about further functions
[ ] Combine the input function with the GUI
[ ] TBD~~

The second idea is to make a resume management platform. I would love to help HR collect resume quickly from their mailbox.
[ ] find a proper dataset
[ ] clean the data
[ ] analyze the inetrview's mail address
[ ] get the resume doc from the mail
[ ] output the result in a folder
