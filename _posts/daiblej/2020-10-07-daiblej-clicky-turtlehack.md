This is pretty hard I think. If without the guide code, I probably have no idea how to start it. I am not that satisfied in the exercise as there are many imprefect details but I don't know how to do so. I will leave a notes here to see whether I can later figure it out:
1. I want to define xcor in an interval, so that if xcor is out of this interval, then the game will end
2. I want to track the turtle's path, so that the game will end not only when the turtle hit the stones but also when its track pass the stone
3. I want to learn more about what should be put in another py. and what should be set in the main.py

However, I also learned a lot from this exercise. I now kind of know how to do the clicks and keys. I also review the xcor, ycor knowledge. I also tried to apply the functions like list, random, loop in my code. I realize only by practicing more can I better understand these functions.
