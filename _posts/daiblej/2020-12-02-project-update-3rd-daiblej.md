This week I mainly work on separating the code into different .py files. 
As I wrote my code locally on my laptop, I haven't got a chance to upload it to trinket. 
But overall, the data cleaning works pretty well and looks clean.
However, at the same time, I'm exploring using pandas to rewrite the code. I found people usually use this module to analyze data and it might be more quickly to do it.
Here is my new snapshot (I upload the code to trinket after the code talk)
