**Janet's Meetup Writeup**

I used the 'meetup' app to look for an event to join. The one I participated in is 'the Monthly Python Meetup in Austin'.  Almost 90 people registered for this event so I guessed this should be a great community. Of course, during this special period, it's an online meetup, but I still got an interesting experience there.

It was a Wednesday night. 50+ people were in the google meeting room. I was surprised that people had such a great passion for this event. As it's online, people in different places were all able to join, regardless of time conflicts. Some of them were on their way home but they can't wait to join. One of them was even in the field waiting for stars with his telescope but used his phone to join the meeting at the same time. That was so cool.

In the beginning, the host introduced some recent conferences([https://global.pydata.org/](https://global.pydata.org/)) and job recommendations([https://www.unitedsolutions.biz/careers/#quote](https://www.unitedsolutions.biz/careers/#quote)) related to Python. Then he invited people to introduce themselves, which was voluntary. I noticed people in this meetup were not all Python professionals and had very various backgrounds. Some people wanted to start a new career or learn a new skill so they came to this meetup to meet new friends and learn new trends in this area. This made me feel much more comfortable. At first, I was afraid that I was too novice to communicate with others, but I realized we all had the same goal for this meetup so it was not difficult to integrate into this community.

Then, a person started to share his new product idea. I guessed he is the owner of a startup in Austin. His presentation talked about the IoT product and how he used Python to develop machine learning in the product. He also shared a view that all the new products have their mobile app when they come to the market, even it's unnecessary. He was developing a facial detection tool. Instead of focusing on the app design, his team wanted to improve the user experience on the product itself, make it more seamless and even delete unnecessary registration. As a UX design student, I can't agree more. I'm glad to know developers also care about the user experience in a product and noticed the experience would be a key to their business success.

Later, another person introduced a data analysis platform, talking about the security of the platform. Unfortunately, I couldn't understand the data theory behind the product. However, I saw many people were passionate to raise their own confusion and potential solutions for the problems that the presenter met. I guessed that should be the reason why people are willing to share their ideas in meetups.

Overall, this was a pretty interesting experience. I like this style of meetups. I see people are all willing to help and to share. This is also a great place for networking. You can meet different people in different areas but have the same interests as you. Also, as I mentioned before, meetups are great places to know new trends and learn new skills. It's really a great chance to jump out of your filter bubbles by talking with different people and listening to different views on the same topic.  

I definitely will attend more meetups in the future. I found there are some meetups for beginners to learn Python and even especially for women. I'm happy to join that one to talk about my learning experience with them. I also found some interesting meetups related to UX design, drawing, and photography. I guess these are also some potential meetups that I want to join in the future. But, I really hope that when the coronavirus is over, I can attend some physical meetups and talk to new friends face-to-face.
