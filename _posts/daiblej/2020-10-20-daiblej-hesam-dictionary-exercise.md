Janet's Reflection:
I was not familiar with the 'Dictionary' at first. However, Hesam is a good teacher. He knows how to write the code short but effective. With his help, we finished the first three exercises during the class. Then I independently finished the last two and modified the alphabetized table in the third one. I went through a lot of materials, like the textbook and stack overflow but I still think Hesam is better than any other materials. In the end, I sent the exercise to him for more advice. He's going to write his response later.

Hesam's Reflection:
Janet and I started pair programming for this exercise and we were able to do almost half of it during the class time. I like the way that pair programming makes each contributor try to think deeply and understand how the could should be structured and implemented. I believe when I am forced to explain something for someone else, I am teaching myself first by trying to make every single thought in my mind clear. After the class we agreed that Janet start thinking about the remaining half and we get together again sometime and she plays the role of navigator this time. Janet took a proactive approach and tried to write the code by herself first and asked me to review it and she did a great job.
About dictionaries, I have to say that it is one of the most interesting data structures in python that working with seems to be really helpful and efficient. I was specifically interested to .get function for adding values in a dictionary and we used it in one of our for loops in this exercise."
