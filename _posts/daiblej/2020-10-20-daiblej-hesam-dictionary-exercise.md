Janet's Reflection:
I was not familiar with the 'Dictionary' at first. However, Hesam is a good teacher. He knows how to write the code short but effective. With his help, we finished the first three exercises during the class. Then I independently finished the last two and modified the alphabetized table in the third one. I went through a lot of materials, like the textbook and stack overflow but I still think Hesam is better than any other materials. In the end, I sent the exercise to him for more advice. He's going to write his response later.
