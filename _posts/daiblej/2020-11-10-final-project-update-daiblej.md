**My final project**
~~The second idea is to make a resume management platform. I would love to help HR collect resume quickly from their mailbox.~~
Last week, I planned to design a resume management platform but it is hard to get this kind of dataset as it's related to others' privacy. So I decided to first look for a dataset and then decide on my final project idea.
I asked my friends where I can find the dataset. Based on her recommendation, I went to the Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/). Then, I found this google play store dataset. This dataset contains multiple features that I can analysis. I decided to use this dataset to recommend the best app for my users. Here is my updated milestones:
- [x] find a proper dataset
- [x] import the data into trinket
- [ ] clean the data
    [ ] delete the columns that are not important
    [ ] minimize the data to suit the trinket size

- [ ] calculate the categories/geners
- [ ] make a dictionary for different categories
- [ ] rank the list by rates, downloads, reviews
- [ ] minimize the list to 10 apps for one category
- [ ] use loop to find the highest rate and the most popular app
- [ ] ask users to choose the type
- [ ] random choose one as recommendation
- [ ] ask user whether they are satisfied wth this recommendation
