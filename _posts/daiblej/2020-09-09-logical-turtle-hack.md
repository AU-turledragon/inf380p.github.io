Here's my Logical Turtle Exercise

I tried to combine a lot I learned in the class. However, I still need to go back to previous notes to check how to write a turtle program. Hope I will become more proficient in the future. 
During my writing process, I found it's difficult to control users' input. If we need a number but they input a string, then the code will go error. From my perspective, it leaves users a very bad impression. My current solution is to use 'try' and 'except' in my code again and again but if we want to publish this code in the real world, how users will react to the program. 
The class materials are good references but as I mentioned at first, there is still a lot needed to be learned. Not sure, but I think maybe, maybe we can speed up. I am happy to learn more difficult and complex functions in python and want to customize my code freely at the end of the class.
