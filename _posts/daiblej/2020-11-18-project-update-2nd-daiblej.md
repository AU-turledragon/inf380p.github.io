This week, I used google colab to clean the dataset. By using different functions, I now have a clearer understanding on the dataset. Google colab is easy to check each step outcome. However, there are some differences between colab and trinket. I have to figure out how to transfer the file to trinket. 
But overall, everything works fine to me.
Next steps, I need to create more dictionaries to better understand the categories and try to visualize them by learning new modules.
