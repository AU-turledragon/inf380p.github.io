Here's the code from my Treasure Turtle exercise:

Reflection:
I struggled with this one for awhile but after doing guess and check for about an hour (the last time), I finally got it to work. It took about three sessions and was a huge relief to finish. I don’t think the code is very neat, however, it does what I want it to do so it’s good enough for me at this stage. :) My biggest issue is that I still don’t feel like I have mastery of functions, especially when I’m trying to use arguments/ parameters. I get that whatever’s in the parentheses after the function name is sort of a placeholder, but I’m really struggling to conceptualize how to use one function multiple different times with different inputs. I kept getting syntax errors or “undefined” because my names weren’t matching up. As I was working through this exercise, I also realized I need to be more careful with including colons after my conditionals and with indentation. Honestly, I’m pretty frustrated with myself and programming in general after the last two modules. I was on track with my work and understanding the material and now I feel completely off course. I tried doubling back on functions by rewatching the Dr. Chuck video again and rereading the chapter but pretty much to no avail. Hoping next week is better but worried about not having a great foundation as of now.
