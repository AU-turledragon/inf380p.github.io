Final Project Update and Milestones

I used this week to study up on concepts I was still feeling hazy about. Because I got sidelined with two other projects, I tried to use the limited time that I could focus on this one to set me up for success next week.
I finished cataloging everything and set up my two CSV files in Trinket. Next, I "cleaned up" all my data by filling in any missing fields and adjusting publisher names to account for mergers, etc. Then I set up my import statements and decided which modules I wanted to use going forward. I watched a handful of videos on Pandas and Dictionaries, but still need some practice with Classes before I jump into trying to define and instantiate a book class for this data.
In regards to the data analysis functions, I made some determinations on how I want to manipulate/ display data and the types of functions I plan to use. I didn't accomplish everything I said I would, as I intended to have the classes and dictionaries set up at this point. That issue was due to bad execution on my part, so it's first up on the list of things to tackle by next week. 

Here's a snapshot of where I'm at:

Milestones/ Successes:
[X] Determine which fields to include in CSVs
[X] Audit personal library
[X] Create CSV file listing entire English-language collection
[X] Create CSV file listing entire Spanish-language collection
[X] Set up (2) files as modules
[] Use classes to set up book class with author, copyright data, author last, author first, publisher, format, genre fields
[] Create dictionaries for each item, put in a list of lists
[] Index the data alphabetized by author last
[X] Determine which functions and types of graphs I want to use to analyze the data sets
[] Set those functions up
[] Visually represent that data with either a graph or chart or both for each function
