I’m interested in using Python to automate a “checking” process for whether or not a library already has certain holdings (rather than searching each item individually), then returning a visualization of which items in a set list already have corresponding items in the UT catalog. 
I’ve been wanting to build a catalog of my own books for awhile now, so this project would jump start that by getting me to audit them and create a data file while providing a fun outlet to think about using Python in a library operations setting. 
I know that a lot of times people want to donate entire personal collections of books to libraries but that it takes a ton of time and work on librarians’ part to determine the eligibility and relevance of each title.

I want to find out, hypothetically, which books of mine the UT library would accept (in this case, accept = they don’t already have a copy). I have a good deal in both English and Spanish so I want to set up two separate CSV files and then check my personal holdings against those of the UT libraries. 
I also want to find out what percentage of my personal collection would be accepted and then find additonal ways to visualize data around the comparison.

Preliminary milestones would be:

- [] Determine which fields to include in CSVs
- [] Audit personal library
- [] Create (2) CSVs listing entire collections
- [] Create various dictionaries for personal holdings 
- [] Somehow automate a "checker" that runs dictionaries against UT holdings
- [] Return data about each item: yes/no in regards to 
- [] Visually represent that data with either a graph or chart or both
