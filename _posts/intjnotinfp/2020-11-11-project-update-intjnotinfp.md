- [X] Determine which fields to include in CSVs
- [X] Audit personal library
- [X] Create (2) CSVs listing entire collections - one done, one to go
- [] Create various dictionaries for personal holdings
- [] Somehow automate a “checker” that runs dictionaries against UT holdings
- [] Return data about each item: yes/no in regards to
- [] Visually represent that data with either a graph or chart or both

This past week I was able to get through "cataloging" a large portion of my library. Here's what the first draft of the CSV file looks like:
