This post is almost identical to last week's because I didn't make any progress over the holiday. I will have wrapped up my other two courses by this evening, so this project will get my undivided attention until Dec. 11th.

Here's a snapshot:

Here are my milestones:

Revised Milestones:

- [x] Determine which fields to include in CSVs
- [x] Audit personal library
- [x] Create (2) CSVs listing entire collections
- [x] Clean up and normalize data fields
- [] Define a "book" class that assigns column headers as attributes
- [] Instantiate the class for each holding
- [] Create various dictionaries for personal holdings
- [] Make a comprehensive list of those dictionaries
- [] Add "help" text
- [] Return a line graph that displays each publication year with # of titles
- [] Set up functions that return text that displays: - # of publishing houses - # of books per publisher - ratio/percentage of paperbacks/hardbacks/ fine bindings to total - percentage of each genre represented in collection - percentage of Spanish to English 

** Outside the scope of project, but potential to continue by: **

- [] Somehow automate a “checker” that runs dictionaries against UT holdings
- [] Return data about each item: yes/no in regards to whether or not library would accept the donation
- [] Visually represent that data with either a graph or chart
