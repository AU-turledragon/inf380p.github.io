# reflection: 

To be honest, Turtles have been my favorite thing we have done so far in class. This is my left brain talking, but I would rather use code to draw cool pictures than compute the whatever from a text file that I don’t know how to access. I have really enjoyed learning Python so far, but turtles have been my favorite. 
A lightbulb moment occurred when we were using geometry and angles to create for loops to create different shapes. Geometry was the only math I ever felt confident in so that is probably why turtles are clicking so much more than other things.
I am still a little confused on how to use chained conditionals with turtles so I hope we talk more about that in class. I attempted one in the homework assignment, but I don’t think that it is very good or useful. I would like to see some more useful examples of chained conditionals and turtles, because I didn’t really see any in the reading for this week.
Working on turtles is making me look forward to the final project where we get to design our own program. Turtles have felt like the most creative thing that we have done so far, so I am excited to continue being creative, especially when we have more freedom to make our own programs at the end of the semester.
