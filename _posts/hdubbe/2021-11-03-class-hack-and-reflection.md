# reflection

I really enjoyed this assignment. I enjoyed making turtle art and seeing what fun colors and shapes the turtle buddies could make. 
My biggest point of frustration in all of this was trying to figure out how to use the random module to create a bunch of random instances of one shape. 
I wanted to make a bunch of random stars appear over my turtle art, but I kept running into errors. I ended up not including the randdom module,
but I would like to employ it in future code. I guess it needs to be added as a parameter and implemented it that way, but I got a lot of syntax errors.
I will work on this issue in the coming weeks.
Otherwise, I have enjoyed learning how to extend the turtle class to make whimsical art. I feel like it has helped me get better at turtles and for loops.
I think there is still a lot left to discover about all that turtles can do, and I am excited to explore that.
