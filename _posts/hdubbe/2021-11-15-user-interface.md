Old Plan:
For my final project, I would like to create a Turtle game where a turtle has to mix batter, bake, decorate and finally deliver a cake. The player will advance through each level by successfully completing the task (baking a cake) according to the parameters I set in my program. The cakes will increase in difficulty as the player passes each level. The first level is a one layer cake, then the second level is a two layer cake, and the third level is a three layer wedding cake.

The first level will require the player to mix the correct amount of each ingredient into the cake batter (flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, vanilla extract), bake the cake at the correct temperature, decorate the cake with at least one type of frosting, and then deliver the cake to the hungry customer.
The second layer will be similar to the first except that the player will need to bake two cakes and layer them on top of each other before decorating them and delivering them to the customer.
The third level (boss level) will be like the first two, except that they will have to bake a three layer cake and decorate it in a traditional wedding style before delivering it to the customer. I will approach this project level by level. By starting with the simplest level myself, I hope to be able to build on the game as I progress through writing my code. This will involve using turtles to draw the cakes themselves and then creating for loops to set the parameters for what the player is supposed to be achieving as they move through the game.

 Modified Plan:
I approached designing my interface by just having a user create a basic cake with clicks. 
This is going to be an animation project, so I want to make sure that I can design all the cakes that I want to make. 
As far as modifying my milestones, I want to stick mostly with the original plan but I might scale back a little. I still want to make sure that I have three levels
where the user bakes cakes of increasing difficulty, but I might need to scale back all the aspects of baking the cakes that I originally wanted to include.
For example, maybe the user doesn't need to mix the ingrediants. That can be a stretch goal. 
I am going to forge ahead with my plan, but potentially scale back if need be.
