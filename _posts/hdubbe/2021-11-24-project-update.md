Okay, so this is not a great project update because my code is still very buggy. I am attempting to make an interface where the user can drag and move around pieces of a cake to build their own cake. For some reason everything gets draggged and dropped all at once and I need to sort that out. That is my plan for the next few days.
As far as milestones go, I have hit making the initial Level One interface, but now I just need to make it work. The next milestone is to get started on Level Two.
