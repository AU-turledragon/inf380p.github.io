In my previous post I made a bold claim about the schedule of my game, a fully interactive with an interactive environment and several smaller games. Having tried to program any semblance of interactivity into one game, it's readily apparent that this was far too optimistic a plan for my project.
I'm downscaling my project to one simple minigame, a functional version of the rhythm game "Bop It". For those who don't know, Bop It is/was a toy where players are given a series of commands that they have to follow in a sequential pattern. If the player is too slow or preforms an incorrect command, the game is over. On the physical game, there are 5 possible commands on the extreme edition: Bop It, Pull It, Twist It, Spin It, Flick It.
In order to program the game into Python, there's a series of tasks that need to be completed for the project to be successful:

1 Align button commands (i.e. space bar for Bop, up key for Spin, down for Pull, etc.) with in-game commands
2 Create a timer that gradually degrades (gets faster as game progresses)
3 Create a score to count how many correct commands were performed in a row 
4 Create a score max that leads to a win screen

Here is the updated schedule/plan for project completion
By November 24th: Create button commands for actions and implement random sequence
By December 1st: Create score table and implement degrading timer (if possible)
By December 8th: Create win screen with score max
