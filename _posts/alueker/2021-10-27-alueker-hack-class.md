Here is my trinket with 4 turtle objects:

For this trinket I wanted to focus on turtle navigation compared to the last assignment where I worked mostly with user input. I recently watched the Netflix series 'Squid Game' and wanted to use python to build the 'squid' court seen in the show, based off an actual Korean game. In the program 4 turtles (named aptly) move around the screen to create the squid court, with one triangle, two circles and one square.
For the interactive aspect of the assignment, I created an input that allowed for users to alter the size of the drawing.
