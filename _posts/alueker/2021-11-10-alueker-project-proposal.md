For my project I want to create a choose your own adventure type game. In it, you control a turtle (literally), choose your color, and interact with a series of buildings/objects in the environment. Within each building there will be a mini game that users will have to complete to win.
This initial prototype is a simple functioning user interface in which the turtle can move up and down the screen with up/down/left/right button commands.
