## My Reflections

At first, I was thinking to create a wep application. However, when I really started working on my final project, I decided to work on a machine learning project that I can get more familiar with Python, libraries such as pandas and matplotlib. Therefore, I started my project with one of the most famous challenges on Kaggle: Titanic Survival Prediction.
I searched how others nailed this project, and start trying to work it on my own. I experienced some struggles while visualizing the data such as stacked bar graphs. Now I'm working on cleaning the data, filling the missing values and so on. I hope I can get to the phase to train and build machine learning models as soon as possible.

## Code

I use [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OppJvh6tZkX5LE5FaOd4v6QzgqEEkAX4?usp=sharing) to work on this project.

## Current Milestones

- [X] Visualize data
- [ ] Clean data and fill missing values
- [ ] Train models
- [ ] Get good prediction rate
