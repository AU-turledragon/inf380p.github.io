## My Final Project Idea

I want to create data visualization work for health informatics. Users can see the trend from past to now, and compare the statistics between factors such as region and gender. If it's possible, I'd like to make it a web application using framework like Django or Flask.

## Initial Work Plan
- [ ] Find a suitable data set
- [ ] Define MVP, design, and structure
- [ ] Research and decide python framework
- [ ] Build the data viz feature
- [ ] Build the interface
- [ ] Revise
