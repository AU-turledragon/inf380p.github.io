## How did it go?

I started to get more experienced and work on projects with ReactJS, and thus I participated in a virtual meetup with the main focus on React Native. I haven't heard or used React Native before joining the meetup. After participating it, I have an overall understanding of the usage and applications of React Native and learn the resources I can seek for as a beginner of React Native.

## What did you learn?

I learned what React Native can do and the resources I can start with. At the same time, I learned the simple structure of the React Native App.

## Would you find value in this kind of event after class?

I think joining this kind of events after class is valuable. Speakers and participants would share new trends in the certain topics. It is also a great place to meet others that can provide help.

## How was the experience different from your expectations?

The participants joining the meetup is fewer than I expected, so it is also cozier. It is a good chance to hear what everyone is up to and learn from their projects.

## Could you see yourself becoming a member of a professional community like this in the future?

Yes, I think joining more events within different communities can help me find out what fits me better.
