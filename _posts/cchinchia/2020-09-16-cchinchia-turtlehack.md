## Relection:
I read the Turtle library and want to find something new to give it a try. When I see the 'onclick' function, I think I can create something that is more intuitive. Instead of typing answers, users only need to click on the screen to trigger an event.
At first, I wanted to create buttons but Turtles don't have buttons. I searched online and found someone's code. That person draw several clickable circles, and when users click on the circles, the background color changes corresponding to the color of the circle. I tried to duplicate the code but failed. I think it's because I didn't provide the correct coordinates to Python.
After a few tries, I decided not to move on with buttons this time, but to make the whole screen clickable. When users click on different quadrants, the background color randomize from different color lists. Also, I used try & except block to detect whether the code works well or not.
