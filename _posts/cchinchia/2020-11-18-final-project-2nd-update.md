I continued working on cleaning the data. I got more familiar with the syntaxes and different practices to fill in missing values and have a better data structure. For the future work, I'll start experimenting different machine learning models and tuning parameters to see how I can achieve the prediction accuracy as high as I can.

### Snapshot for current progress
I use [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OppJvh6tZkX5LE5FaOd4v6QzgqEEkAX4?usp=sharing) to work on this project.
