## Progress

I finished data cleaning, filling missing values, and transforming categorical values into integers. Then I moved on to the next phase which is model training. The next step for me is to create an user interaction function for users to select which model they'd like to see its prediction result.

## Reflection

At first, I thought I would directly start working on model training. However, there are quite an amount of works to do for the dataset to get ready to train. I actually spent most of the time doing preparation work, including visualizing the data to learn the possible factors and cleaning the data to make sure the format of the dataset is good for training. 

## Code Snapshot

I upload to [Github](https://github.com/cchinchia/Titanic-Challenge/blob/main/snapshot-20201202.ipynb)

## Current Milestones

- [X] Visualize data
- [X] Clean data and fill missing values
- [X] Train models
- [ ] User interaction function
