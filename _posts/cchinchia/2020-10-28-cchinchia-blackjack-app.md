## Reflection
Working for this project is interesting for me. I enjoy the thinking process that I tried to make this program works better. 

At first, I wrote the code that can only run for one time. Then I realized this is where functions can come in and create a loop for the program to run until it meets certain criteria. I also learned to implement is to use “while True” when I want to create a program that can run forever. Besides, I think this is a good practice for me to combine and utilize the knowledge I have to create the code that’s from my own hands. What’s more, I leveraged what I learnt in class to make my code look cleaner and simpler (still a long way to go though). Through this project, I become more experienced in defining functions to break down the whole program and more familiar with different methods such as loops and list methods.

Also, it is helpful for me to discuss with someone else that we write totally different codes for the same project topic. Since I’ve thought about how to write for a certain feature, it’s inspiring to see another approach tackling with the same issue I had (and even smarter). At the same time, I get to know how others think of my code, and learn what I did good and where I can improve.

After this project, I feel more confident to develop programs for other things. I gain the ability to analyze steps in one program and deal with struggles by myself.   

## Revised Milestone List

- [x] Break down the program into steps
- [x] Define initial card setting and general value (player's card total)
- [x] Define function to deal a new card
- [x] Define function to compare the card between player and dealer
- [x] Define function when the player "hits"
- [x] Define main function to make everything work together
