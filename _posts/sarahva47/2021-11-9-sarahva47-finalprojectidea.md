title: Sarah Varenhorst's Final Project Idea and Work Plan
---

For the final project, I want to make a Turtle game. I'm still a little unclear on what my own abilities will be for the semester and how feasible my current idea is, but so far I have a general idea of what I would like to do. It is important to note that this work plan is due November 10th, two days before Red (Taylor's Version) by Taylor Swift releases and this has been the singular focus of my mind and will continue to be the only thing on my mind for the rest of the semester. With that said, I want to make a game around Taylor Swift. This game is for a very specific audience (myself ando ther Swifties).

My current idea is a game where I import an image of Taylor's face to be the Turtle. You play as Taylor collecting song lyrics to All Too Well (Taylor's Version) in order of the lyrics to earn red scarves as points. This is a three-level game. The first level, the user collects the lyrics, in order, to just the infamous bridge. In the second level, the user collects the lyrics, in order, to the whole song. The third level, the user collects the lyrics, in order, to the ten-minute version. If they mess up, they have to restart at the beginning of the stanza from which the last-correct lyric originated. The user has to watch out, though, because if Taylor hits a random Jake Gyllenhaal on the screen, they have to restart the level. If they get through all three levels, they win! On the win screen, the song (normal-length) plays and there is an image of Jake Gyllenhaal (the subject of the song) crying. There will not be a losing screen, since the goal of the game is repetition and encouragement until a user has the lyrics memorized (e.g., no learned helplessness). Therefore, a user can repeat the game and win the game, but cannot lose the game. 

My current work plan: 
1) I suppose the first step is to clear up how to do any of this, and go back to the drawing board if this project isn't feasable. How do I import an image? How do we make a Turtle move around and collect things like in the game example that was shown on the first day of class? 
2) Identify images to import; I may draw the Taylor Turtle myself and the scarves to make cute, pixellated ones if I can't find something usable (as far as copyright restrictions or anything) on the Internet. 
3) Ensure I can import the song and images into the Trinket
4) Try to use dictionaries to set up the lyrics.
5) Take the project level-by-level, focusing on level 1, level 2, level 3, then the win screen. 
6) Test and re-test the game, checking for bugs
7) Have a Swiftie friend play the game as a small goal of user testing
