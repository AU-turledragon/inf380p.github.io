# Progress since last class

In the spirit of honesty, I do not have much to report on this week. I built in buffer time on my original project plan for this past week, knowing that I had some personal matters on my schedule that would take up a lot of my free time. All that I worked on was the UI sketch and identifying the datasets I need to use.
That said, I have updated my project plan a smidge, as I still need to comb through the .csv file of environmental toxins and filter only data for my selected cities (e.g. LA, Chicago, Houston, NYC), as well as delete columns of data that I will not be using, since this file is rather enormous. Additionally, I still need to do the same for the demographic data, which will be analyzed against the toxin data.

# Reflection
I am definitely a little overwhelmed with this final project, as it is one of three pretty large final projects I have due at the end of the semester, on top of continuous grading for the class I am TAing. I realize this situation makes it all the more important that I chip away at my project plan little by little, rather than expecting myself to accomplish large chunks of it in just a couple sittings. I will be making a lot more progress this weekend and over Thanksgiving break.
Creating the user interface was an insightful task, and although I am not sure it drastically changed the trajectory of my project, it did make me think more critically about (1) how I will use these datasets, and (2) what functionality I want the program to have for the user. Now that I have a UI sketch, I am thinking about how to make it more interesting, rather than a simple main menu with two selections (graphical representations and summary statistics). I think the datasets I have chosen are so robust, and I have the ability to let users choose even more things besides city, e.g. a specific ethnic population or income level.
