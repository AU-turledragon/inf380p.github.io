title: "Last Project Update and Standup Report"

I am repentant to say that unfortunately I do not have much of an update this week. I spent all of my free (read: not spent with family for the holiday) time over Thanksgiving break on a project for another class that took me 30+ hours, and sadly, that was not even a final.
As such, the only code I have yet is my UI. I did spend time narrowing and cleaning my datasets, which was frustrating and took a lot longer than expected. The environmental toxin data was actually simpler to find, and I only needed to trim some columns. However, it was hard finding demographic data that matched the timeframe of the environmental toxins data. The U.S. Census 2020 website is cumbersome, to say the least. 

At this point, my project plan is basically a blitzkrieg for the next week. I will devote the next few days to this project.

# Reflection

The biggest issue for me right now is execution. I knew the end of the semester was going to be rough, but I did not anticipate how balancing multiple finals project, pre-finals projects, and grading would truly not allow to accomplish everything without starting weeks, if not a month or two, in advance. 
Additionally, I don't know if I have hit the "exponential level of learning" associated with coding yet. It still gives me anxiety to sit down to a blank terminal and start writing a program. This anxiety has made me uncomfortable with sitting down for 30 minutes here or there to chip away at this project. 
Rather, I feel like I need to devote hours if I want to make any progress. Thankfully, when I wrote my project plan initially, I think I came up with a project idea and milestones that are doable but still challenging. Although I am nervous as I get pressed for time, I believe I can accomplish my milestones still in the next few days.
Looking back, I should not have planned anything around Thanksgiving. I didn't realize I'd have to spend so much of last week on one project for another class. I am looking forward to writing the reflection for this project (when I actually have code to discuss), as I think it will be a huge learning moment for me. 
I can honestly say I think I may hit the exponential stride as I work on this the next few days.

# Updated Project Plan

My project plan remains largely the same but with new dates.

|Milestone|Notes|
|---|---|
|<ul><li>[x] **1.	Nov. 12:** Identify cities and toxins to examine, and select data sets to use, possibly on Kaggle.|Environmental toxins dataset can be found at: https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-basic-data-files-calendar-years-1987-present While geographically sliced demographic data can be found at: https://data2.nhgis.org/main|
|<ul><li>[x]  **2.	Nov. 19:** Clean up the data set(s) and merge, if necessary.|
|<ul><li>[ ]  **3.	Dec.1-Dec.6:** Write code to analyze the data and pull summary statistics. Build dictionaries/lists/tuples to store the data.|
|<ul><li>[ ]  **4.	Dec.1-Dec.6:** Write functions that allow users to retrieve summary statistics and produce graphical representations of the analysis.|
|<ul><li>[ ]  **5.	Dec.1-Dec.6:** Create the user instructions and help text and add in comments.|
|<ul><li>[ ]  **6.	Dec. 6:** Fine tune code to ensure all graded components are in the game; write final reflection.|
|<ul><li>[ ]  **7.	Dec. 8:** DUE DATE! Submit pull request for final project and reflection.|
