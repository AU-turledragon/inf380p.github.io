# Project Idea

My final project will be a data analysis project. As much as I loved the turtles, I think it will be good practice and a challenge for me to try a more analytical project. 

One of my research interests is in environmental justice. I want my final project to look at different neighborhoods within 1-3 metropolitan areas in the U.S.—I am choosing between Houston, L.A., Chicago, NYC—and analyze the presence of environmental toxins versus demographics of each neighborhood. My working hypotheses are that neighborhoods that are predominantly majority people of color and/or low income will have significantly higher levels of toxins.

I will first need to narrow down the metropolitan areas and select specific toxins. I think this will largely be dependent on which datasets I can find. For my analysis, I will look at how toxins are correlated (or not) with various race, gender, and income demographics. I will produce summary statistics and histograms, as well as potentially line graphs, if I can find longitudinal data.

#  Milestones and Tentative Work Plan

**1.	Nov. 12:** Identify cities and toxins to examine, and select data sets to use, possibly on Kaggle.\
**2.	Nov. 14:** Clean up the data set(s) and merge, if necessary.\
**3.	Nov. 21:** Write code to analyze the data and pull summary statistics. Build dictionaries/lists/tuples to store the data.\
**4.	Nov. 28:** Write functions that allow users to retrieve summary statistics and produce graphical representations of the analysis.\
**5.	Dec. 4:** Create the user instructions and help text and add in comments.\
**6.	Dec. 6:** Fine tune code to ensure all graded components are in the game; write final reflection.\
**7.	Dec. 8:** DUE DATE! Submit pull request for final project and reflection.
