Here's my example about parsing and manipulating data from a text file. The exercise asked us to define a function that will return the average PM 2.5 value for a particular state based on city pollution data contained in the document uspoll.txt.

So...
This code defines a function `avg_PM25()`, which will take the argument `(state)`.
```
def avg_PM25(state):
```
When called and provided with an argument, the function will call upon the file handle `inFile`, opening the file "uspoll.txt" in `r`ead mode. 
...to be continued...
