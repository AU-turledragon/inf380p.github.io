title: "EAkita's Reflection for the first class!"
---

I joined the class late, so I went through the video and did the assignments. Also, in the second class, we went over the assignments from the first class. Seeing how others solved the problems gave me a better framework to think through he exercises and write much better code. Also, through the videos,  
I understood the issue differences in using the”import turtle” vrs “from turtle import *” and how they are applied in the code. 

Furthermore, I learnt a lot of new things in this first class while going through the assignments. 

I looked up cool 2D shapes to draw, and then stumbled on the spirograph. So I spent some time exploring, and I realized I could use the ".left" method to move a few pixels and repeat the circle. I also wanted to test out using functions, which is something I'm trying to get better at (actually, I'm trying to understand classes and objects better). So I played with a few structures and found that I could ask the use to input 3 colors, then use these colors in drawing my circles. I didn't use a for loop in the function, which would have made it much easier and simpler, because I was trying to highlight the key take-away from this lesson. However, in the latter part of my code, I decided to add triangles, and this is where I leveraged the for loop structure, which seemed to work pretty well. I think my code is decently documented. 

Another big take-away was white spaces in code. I played around with the last and first name ordering for my second assignment and I realized that the "white spaces" is a serious issue in python, so I started paying attention to it.

Also, knowing about data types was great for solving one of the problems. Since we covered some data types in class, I played around with forcing the input as a float, then printed the provided name and returned the value of the pay as a forced string. This is because, I learnt that python can only concatenate data types which are similar. I also use the round function to round off to 2 decimal places. 

Was a good first class!
