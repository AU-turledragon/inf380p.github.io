Reflection
I missed the first half of class today, however, I got all caught up when I joined. I was a little confused about whitespaces with operators and if/else statements, and I think I got the hang of it. Finally, I fell in to the habbit of overcommenting my code, which made it look messy. So I tried to create more meaningful variables with explicit structures, which required less comments. All in all, had a fun day, learning new things today!
