# Reflection
# 1.Topic Selection
Airbnb had attracted many Chinese users and I also use airnb when traveling in other cities, Jingde Village is a famous scenic spot in China and I am also interested in   tourists performance in house lease in Jingde Village and the houses performance on this platform. In Airbnb app, users must register and create an account, and each house is linked to a landlord. In my original data, I have columns as follows: order_date (user order time, price, room type price, whether there is a discount), the description of the room type (location, area, equipment provided, etc.), the user's personal and historical information (e.g, average consumption price, etc.). The abundant data arouse my interest in exploring some interesting findings here.
# 2.Process
I experienced 4 milestones during the final project in about 2 weeks. 
In milestone1, I made brainstorm and data clean. When facing such a huge data set(there were 30,000 data in the original data set) I was lost what part I should start with. Then I made a brainstorm and listed all my data analysis idea, for example, I would like to see how does the total numbers of orders change over time in 2019 so I plan to draw a time series graph, I also wanted to know which city is popular among tourists so I plan to use bar charts to sort top 10 cities according to the order numbers. 
However, when uploading my csv document into Trinket, it took very long time to read csv and finally failed. I asked for peers about the reason, and got the answer that the size of document will effect the speed of this python online editor, so I changed my final project plan and did a quick data clean work, I deleted some columns that I wouldn’t need to use originally, then I also delete the order_date and hotel_city to adapt to Trinket accommodation and left 61data, finally I decided my topic as the Airbnb house analysis in Jingde Village in 6/12/2019.
In milestone 2, I made data analysis based on present data. Firslt I imported math library and used internal functions like, min(), max(). and mean() to show fundamental statistic of the order price, giving users an overview of the price data, then I defined room category by size to help users recognize their aimed houses’ marketing position, then I will guide users to see the cost performance of the house to help them make the best choice.
In milestone 3, I learned data visualization and drew 2 graphs here. Basically,I made an assumption that house price increases with the size of room area accordingly, so to study the correlation between these arguments, I searched how to show this relationship and used seaborn library to draw a correlation graph. The reference is listed below.

Besides, I wonder tourists from which cities prefer to visit Jingde Village so I planned to use Matplotplib library and bar chart to illustrate result clearly, I used value_counts function to count by cities category and used head function to only display top 10 data.
What’s more, through observing the csv sheet, I found that many users come from one city, so I am curious if there is a difference in consumption level between them, then considering that in the structure of the dictionary, the key-value pair can be used to record data flexibly, therefore, I used the key to record the user's city of origin, and used the list as the value to record the consumption of travelers from this city.Through the apply function of the dataframe, I recorded the data in csv into a dictionary. At this time, each key (city) in the dictionary corresponds to a series of consumer prices. After traversing these cities one by one, I got the average consumption level of tourists from each city. Following is the tutorial I learned.

In milestone 4, I made a wrap up here, I modified bugs, ran my codes smoothly and prepared my final presentation. I also added interactive and iterative interface here by using “if and else sentences”, users can type into commands I listed repeatedly to trigger different functions I defined. And the help text box is used to offer tips that users can only type in integers or float numbers otherwise will report mistakes in this program.
# 3.Finding memos
My final project got 2 findings based on the graphs.
① House price and room area display a weak correlation with a coefficient number of 0.38 (far lower than 1), and the top 10 due to the lack of abundant number, however, there are still many other factors like the room decoration, geographic location to effect the final price of airbnb house, so it needs further study here.
②Guiyang, Wenzhou, Haikou, Shanghai, Changsha, Suzhou are predominant cities that have more tourists paid visit to Jingde Village and tourists average consumption level also keep lead, because these cities are all lies in northern China and is closed to Jingde Village, besides, these cities are all first-tier cities and residents' income and living standards come out in front, so residents there are more willing to pay expense outside their lives to meet the highest needs of Maslow's theory. In this case, I suggest Jingde village government consider to collaborate with these cities and form more closed relationship in introducing more local tourists to visit, for example, provide opportunities for mutual exchange and learning, promote some incentives or discount activities. 
# 4.Skills and Attitudes
This semester I registered for 2 technical course, the one is inf 380P which taught me to use python, while the other requires me to use python pandas library directly and make data analysis and data visualization work. Sometimes I still feel not really familiar with python and I need to modify my codes many times, even after checking for some tutorials I can make it. So before starting my final project, I sorted python structure I learned in this course before digging into final project and I mainly reviewed conditional sentences, dictionaries, function parts and searched some tutorials to draw graphs. 
Firstly, during project completion, I really enjoyed the process of putting theory into practice, and solve various problems by myself. I felt the sense of achievable when seeing I got response from my code lines. When I confront with some errors, I Googled for the reasons and methods, learn from the solutions shared by the geeks and tried to solve it by myself then understand the connotation of the code.
Secondly, it’s unforgettable to become calm when debugging, the most often seen bugs are unexpected indent and the problem of coexist of string and integer. Colab and trinket has gap in using indent so finally I decided to use “tab” button to unify all indents rather than adjust spaces manually. Besides, the main reason of data type error is that I have no awareness of converting string to integer data types in time when writing code.
Thirdly, I really enjoy the process of brainstorming and I thought I had brilliant ideas in milestone 1, when observing data set, I usually consider questions as follows, what descriptive statistics can I get from the data set? What business issues do I want to analyze from this data set? Which columns of data do will help solve these problems? And here I would express that It’s a pity if I could run code in Pycharm or local editor to accommodate bigger size document. Besides, I found my interest in data visualization this semester, Tableau helps me to be more sensitive towards the relationship between sheets, columns and keys, and I applied this sensitivity to this final assignment, 
# 5.Deficiency and future work
Firstly, because the less data, there is still much space for improvement, for example, I hope to use a map graded by color palatte according to the number of room orders to display scenic spots popularity. Besides, the findings are still shallow and the suggestion is not concrete based on the poor knowledge of business and marketing sense. What’s more, I think my user interface still needs to be beautified, tips are crowded together and it’s hard for users to distinguish, if I can start new lines and change font size, user experience will be optimized, and there is still a question I need to reconsider,the sense of achievement in programming comes from beautiful codes or beautiful functions? Lastly, I believe success of running codes doesn’t represent you really master programming, there are still many ways to merge or simplify my code to make them more readable.
