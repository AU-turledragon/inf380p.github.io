Milestone completion status:
-
Milestone 2 finished (data analysis)


Updates of project plan:
-
- I add the category of the room area
- I may remove the time series analysis of room orders because after checking the "order_date" column, I found it only record one day---06/12/2017, thus I can make a statistics of what period in that day has the most high volumn of order.
- I changed the tool of Colab to Trinket
- I add a library I used: seaborn


Reflection:
-
I think my final project is in good shape and doesn't seem like to ambitious. I can continue to make further progress. 
When making plan, I made a mistake that I hope to draw a time series graph to show the change of number of orders, but I found that the date column only displayed in a specific day when operating milestone 1, so i change my plan. Besides, I also enjoy the process of following the tutorials and modify my codes. I learnt to draw bar charts by using matplotplib and the correlation chart to see some insightfu; findings.

Barriers:
- I don't know how to import/read my local csv document into trinket.
- I was confused with how to parse time period and still on the way to find some tutorials about this.

Future planï¼š
- finish milestone 3(data visualization) and 4(wrap up)
