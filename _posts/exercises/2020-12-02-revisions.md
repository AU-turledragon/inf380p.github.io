title: "Homework Revisions (Optional)"
---

You may submit up to 3 items of revised or re-submitted homework on Trinket and/or Github. This is intended to encourage you to revisit areas of our course material that weren't as clear to you.

In addition, you may revise your App Project and reflection.

**For Github-based (re)submissions,** preserve the original reflection and code below the new submission.

Once you have completed **all** of the revisions you intend to, email or Canvas message me and Misha with links to the pull requests and/or specific Trinket items you revised so that we can review them.
