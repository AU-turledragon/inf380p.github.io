# Reflection
This update is not so much an update so much as it is a confession. As it stands, my code is essentially the same as it was last week since I was caught up with other priorities and deadlines this last week of classes. That being said, I will be able to fully commit a solid week to this project alone, therefore I believe that I will be able to make the necessary progress that this final assignment calls for. Much of this coming week will be dedicated to reviewing past class recordings and materials, espeically the custom modules unit.

My milestones remain roughly the same as the last update, however, the one change I did make was that I wanted to restructure my "rooms" dictionary so that the player's progression through the text-adventure narratively makes more sense and flows better. This may or may not become an "if time" item though if I am pressed for time on fulfilling just the basic requirements for this project. Dates for milestone deadlines have been also modified to reflect the new expedited plan. ([Link](https://inf380p.github.io/Elizard0926-Interface-Draft.html) to previous update)
