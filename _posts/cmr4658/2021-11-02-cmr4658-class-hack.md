# Reflection

Overall, I thought this assignment was pretty straightforward since I accidentally did something very similar for my previous assignment. 

One thing I was able to improve on was the process of extending the class. In my previous assignment, I wanted to add features to the original Turtle class without overwriting the constructor method, so I made a Turtle object that was nested inside the new class:

```
self.turtle = Turtle()
```

This time, I used the `super()` method, which was a lot cleaner and more straightforward:

```
super().__init__(xpos, ypos, color)
```

This let me add to the constructor method of the original class without completely overwriting it.

I also decided to just make a general polygon method instead of writing out all the different shapes:

```
def draw_polygon(self, sides, size=200):
    angle = 360/sides
    side_length = size/sides
    for i in range(sides):
      self.right(angle)
      self.forward(side_length)
```
