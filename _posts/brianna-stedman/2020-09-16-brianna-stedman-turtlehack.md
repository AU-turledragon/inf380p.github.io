This is a placeholder until I finished the turtlehack that I am wanting to do! This is what I have so far:

I'm also writing up my reflection right now. I'm a little behind on a lot of things this week and am doing my best to catch up. This is a snippet of code that I found online while looking up all the things that the turtle package can do! The link that was given to us ("documentation" I think?) was pretty technical so I googled a "for dummies" list, similar to everything listed out on our Trinket exercises from the first week - I refer back to that pretty often too! However obviously I don't want to just copy and paste so I'm making sure I can go through the whole thing and understand and explain all that's happening, also while making it my own. So this is still a work in progress but I think the idea of it is so cool and it looks awesome.
