Here is the turtle treasure hunt I built:

One of the trickiest parts was figuring out how to express to the user their distance from the answer. I initially wanted to give a more exact number, but the easiest and best way that has worked out for me so far was using a more relative distance (hotter/colder, etc) to express it until you're close enough to hit the target. I played it several times unsuccessfully until I figured out the < and > for the relative distance hints, then I was able to play it successfully. I'm excited to have learned about While loops, because I've seen potential uses for them in our past assignments, and just didn't know how to do them before. 
I also adjusted the range of integers to be randomly selected from 0 to 100 instead of -200 to 200, for troubleshooting purposes.
