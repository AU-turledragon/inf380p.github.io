I haven't made a lot of ground on my final yet, I've been working with the same data set for a final in another class. What I did start this week was the initial help messages, figuring out what certain functions I will be defining to keep my code neat, importing my data files (I may be switching to use different files than the ones I'd already chosen) and also beginning to figure out where using a dictionary would be relevant to my project. 
Upon further work it also seems tricky to build an "add notes" function to update the player csv/create a new file, so I have moved that to my stretch goal section.

- [ ]Import data files
- [x]Provide welcome/how-to text on the starting page
- [x]Build “help” function that returns the how-to text when user requests it
- [ ]Accept user input in form of team name or player name, return a list of options to view for each
- [ ]When user selects team name, ask if user would like a roster or a statistic
- [ ]If user selects roster, read through the file and return all players on that team and their stats
- [ ]If user selects a statistic, specify which one (ppg, rpg, apg); return calculated aggregated statistic for all players on that team
- [ ]If user selects player name, return stats, nickname, info, etc for that player
- [ ]Build “print all” function that cleanly returns all csv data if requested

I'm moving a few milestones to stretch goals as well:
- [ ]Use classes to build two functions (“compare teams” and “compare players”) that accepts the input of multiple team or player names, and returns rows of stats/aggregated stats.
- [ ]Give user option to input notes on each player and update those to the original data files (*or create a new file only with notes!*)
- [ ]Build “view notes” function that returns only a list of players with a note attached (*or only returns the new file with player stats and notes!*)
- [ ]Build "clear notes" function to erase all and remove from the new file
