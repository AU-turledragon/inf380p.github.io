Hi there, hopefully this will work out. 

I think I'm a big fan of Trinket! I really like how easy and integrated the exercises are with the course materials. I pulled up the Trinket Chapter 2 exercise in one tab, and 
the Chapter 2 materials in the other tab after reading through it, and I found that pretty easy! I mentioned within my submission itself, but my biggest issue was concatenating
the string "Hello" with the variable input of the name, so I used https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_string_concatenation.asp to help with the syntactical questions I had. 

Github is something that I really need to get the hang of. This is where the majority of my lapses in vocabulary and understanding happen. I messed up last week's pull request, 
and in trying to write this week's reflection post, I'm not 100% sure I actually know what I'm doing here. I feel pretty confident in the chapter exercises with Python, since there 
is a dedicated place to input and submit those snippets of code. However, when it comes to actually editing the website... I'm using the "Github basics" step-by-step on the "How To" 
page to have gotten this far, so that's really helpful, but not having a fundamental understanding of what pull requests actually are or how to "commit" things has made it really difficult. 

Don't worry, I'm keeping track of the vocab I'm missing so hopefully we can cover it in class!
