What is Tina's favorite color? Give it your best guess! If you're correct, she'll do a little happy dance.

Reflection:
Like Ayu said, only having 10 minutes to come up with something was more of a creative challenge than anything else! After going through the homework assignments in class more thoroughly, I felt a lot more comfortable trying different conditionals, so it was really just coming up with what I wanted my trinket to 'do.' I did run into some issues with lowercase vs uppercase letters in colors, python is case sensitive, right? I'd like to look into some wildcard characters to see if that would help with other issues such as "pInk" or "pinK" or "Pink!". I assume that is a think that exists, since it exists in SQL too. It was also neat to meet with Claire and Jasmine and see what they had come up with. Everyone has such different ideas, it always gives me a new one to try out next time.
