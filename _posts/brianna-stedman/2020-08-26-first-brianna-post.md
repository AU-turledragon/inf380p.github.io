Hi, my name is Brianna (or Bri, whichever is easier for you to remember). I'm a second year graduate student in the iSchool, with a focus in public librarianship (or data science, haven't really decided yet), and my undergrad degree is in English and education. I've been interested in programming for a little while, and had a taste of Python in a course this spring, but COVID-19 put some dampers on that. 
When I'm not in school, I play on UT's club women's ultimate frisbee team, Melee. I also have two cats, Charles and Jack, and I spend a lot of time doing projects of all varieties (learning things, building things, etc). My next project is teaching Jack how to paddleboard with me! Ideally, we'll become so Instagram-famous that my Masters degree will be rendered irrelevant. Then I'll know what true success looks like.
