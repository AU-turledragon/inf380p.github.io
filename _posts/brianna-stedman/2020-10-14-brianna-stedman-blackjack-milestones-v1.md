Below you can find my intended milestones for my Blackjack project. 

- [ ] Accept input from user for name to print a welcome message to the game 
- [ ] Deal two "cards" (randomized number 2-10 or A/J/Q/K - probably will use a separate module to create a deck of cards with all combinations)
- [ ] Compute the sum of the numbers and keep a running list using a for loop, print the sum for the user
- [ ] Accept user input to "Hit," on which: deal another "card," add the total to the running sum
- [ ] Accept user input to "Stay," on which: do not deal another card
- [ ] If running sum of user is >21, print loser message
- [ ] If running sum of user is <21 and user inputs "Stay," then print a randomized number between 16-21 as computer's score
- [ ] If computer score > user score, print loser message 
- [ ] If computer score < user score, print winner message 
- [ ] Use while loop to ensure game continues to ask for user input until the user inputs "Stay"
- [ ] Accept input from user for whether they would like to play a new game or not; if "Yes" then re-run program (not 100% confident on how to do this yet), if "No" then exit the loop
