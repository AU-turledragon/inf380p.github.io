title: "Blackjack Initial Milestone"

The requirements for this blackjack app can be found [here](https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2017_spring/inls560_001/a/4.html). For this project, these are the initial milestones I'm setting.

- [ ] The program should be able to deal two cards to the user and compute the sum
- [ ] The user should be able to choose if they want to hit or stay
- [ ] If the user chooses to hit, the program should deal a new card and compute the new sum
  - [ ] If the user chooses to hit and the new sum is under 21, the program should request the user to hit or stay
  - [ ] If the user chooses to hit and the new sum is over 21, the program should end the game
- [ ] If the user chooses to stay, the program should be able to generate two cards and compute the sum for itself, then compare it with the user's sum to see who wins
- [ ] When the user wins or loses, the program should prompt the user if it wants to play again
