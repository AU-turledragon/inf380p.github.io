My Trinket for the logical turtle exercise:

With the short time frame that was given (around 10-15 minutes), I had a hard time trying to think of what I want the turtle to actually do and I think I ended up spending around half the time overthinking it. At first I wanted to make it do a bunch of fancy stuff (mainly use the different user inputs to essentially "instruct" the turtle to do things), but I didn't have the time to think of all the things, so I simplified it even further to prompt the user to choose between three options. The output is different for each option, and if the user inputs something that's not part of the options given, I've got a sort-of error message, too.

I think I just really need to get used to actually diving into things headfirst, especially when it comes to coding. If I try to think too much or too hard or too long, I tend to get wrapped up in the complexities and all the tiny bits and pieces necessary and that just makes things harder for me on the long run. I suppose that's kind of how I've always approached a lot of these problems: wanting to really nail down the details to get the big picture correct on the first go (measure twice cut once type of deal), but it's not really how programming should work. Having to re-wire my brain into thinking error messages are just like notifications or reminder post-it notes is definitely going to take some, but hopefully I'll get there, and also just reminding myself constantly that "just go for it" is a perfectly appropriate approach.
