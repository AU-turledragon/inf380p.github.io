Not sure if it was planned or not, but lecture felt a little... packed/rushed, especially towards the end. I think we didn't get to the in-class exercises until the last half hour or so of class, which was okay but I did feel a little bit out of my depth as we tried to wrap things up quickly. I'll have to go back to re-read the notes for last lecture.

I thought going over the Trinket exercises with the whole class was really nice; it's good to see how other people approach problems and write their codes, and it's also nice to see how one approach compares to another.

When it comes to the independent exercises, I thought it was relatively straightforward. I was a little scared, to be honest, because conditional statements can get complicated, and I sometimes don't always find the most efficient way around it. Logical statements, math-things related to proofs, and other things along that nature were always my weakpoint, but I had the basic understanding of if-then statements. Ultimately, that was how I approached the exercises on Trinket.

Both Trinket exercises were relatively straightforward once I get to the actual coding, but I had a little bit of a hard time wrapping my head around if/else/elif statements, specifically how they relate to and affect one another and when to use which. There are still some nuances that I don't quite understand, but my partner helped a little in explaining the concepts/theory of some of the material that the chapter covered regarding conditionals. He completed his undergrad in computer science and has been working as a software engineer for the past two years or so, so he has loads more experience with the language than I do. Truth be told, it always intimidated me a bit, but he was very patient with my basic "why this and that" questions and explaining the concepts. He actually offered to help me work through the problems, but I told him that I wanted to take first crack and complete them myself and then have him take a look and give feedback or try to explain things I still didn't quite get. 

He did ask if the codes we're writing need to pass professional code reviews, and I told him no, at least not at this point. He didn't really say what that entails, but I'm sure that the pieces of code that I've been writing wouldn't pass code reviews without some major revisions. I suppose we'll see when the time comes!
