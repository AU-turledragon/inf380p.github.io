I had attended an online workshop for an introduction to the Pandas library that was run by Thinkful. I had found them through Eventbrite. While browsing for potential events to attend, it surprised me a little bit on how hard it is to find an alright-looking event on Eventbrite that didn't cost me money. Thanfully, Thinkful runs these free workshops, partially as a marketing strategy but also as a chance to share knowledge.

The virtual workshop itself wasn't all too bad. The presenter gave us a link to a Google Colab document that we needed to make a copy of to follow along during the 2.5 hour workshop ([here's my copy](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11Z9ph6MBU-Sdrd4WGvKoJ7cVEoClQwcZ)). It touched on some of the basic uses of the Pandas library and followed a general workflow of downloading and cleaning data, in this case data related to box office earnings of different movies.

There were some really nifty stuff that we went over, even though it was just the simplest of functions from the Pandas library. `.head()` and `.tail()` lets you see the top and the bottom of the data. `.describe()` gives the basic statistical analysis of the data set (mean, median, mode, etc.), which is pretty neat; all that calculation done from one function. 

The part that really kind of lost me is the data cleaning portion of the workshop. At this point the presenter had realized he spent too long taling about the "understanding the data" bit and tried to zoom through the data cleaning portion, which was probably not the best idea seeing how dense this part is. At this point, I could tell my approach had changed from curious exploration of to just simply copy-pasting everything the presenter was telling us to type. Ultimately, the workshop felt super rushed at the end, and I left the virtual meeting at 10:30 PM (because this workshop ran from 8 PM to 10:30 PM on a Thursday) feeling like I was talked *at* and not talked *to*.

All in all, it wasn't a bad workshop, and I had a short glimpse of what the Pandas library can do. However, because it was run by Thinkful, which is one of those bootcamp academies, they subtly but definitely were encouraging the participants to consider enrolling in their programs. I've had a look at them before I started my master's degree; it was enticing, but I'd rather earn a degree from a good university than a certification from a bootcamp.
