title: "Final Project 11/18 Update"
---

Truth be told, I haven't gotten a chance to make any updates or changes to my project since last week. It's been a rough and exhausting past few weeks, and I think I'm losing steam in terms of the drive and motivation I have in the beginning of the semester. Not super sure how to tackle the loss in motivation honestly, but the fact that there is a hard deadline for this project keeps the fire under my feet lit, and it'll just be up to me to actually do something about it.
Not entirely sure what happened between last week and this week, but the data files that I got and tinkered with somehow corrupted when it saved at some point, and I couldn't recover it to the non-corrupted version, so I had to start from scratch in terms of cleaning up the data. I had a chance to think about other components that needed clarification, though, so I guess that's a plus on my book.

- [x] Get air traffic & on-time data for 2019
  - [x] Find the data
  - [x] Clean the data
    - **11/18 update:** data re-downloaded and re-cleaned
- [] Program should be able to read the data (either in .txt or .csv format)
- [] Program should be able to take user inputs
  - [x] Determine what kind of user inputs 
    - **11/18 update:** inputs will be 3-letter airport code, airport name, and/or airport city
  - [x] Determine what kind of data analysis (in general) program should be able to do
    - **11/18 update:** generate information on delays (types of delays, percentage of a whole, total sum), information on which airlines are most often affected by delays
- [] **New milestone (11/18):** Program should be able to return basic airport information like name, city, state, hub type, 2019 enplanement data & rank 
- [] Program should be able to return statistics depending on the input
- [] Program should include a "Help" function
  - [] Determine what should go in the function
 
Some stretch goals that would be an interesting addition to the program:
- [] Find national weather data for 2019 (note: might need to find weather data from/around the airports itself)
- [] Find more specific air travel data (international vs. domestic arrival/departure)
- [] Program might be able to identify/compare data from international & domestic flights for a given airport
- [] Program might be able to identify if a given airport is an airline hub
- [] Find "historical" data (the past ~5-10 years) so program might be able to compute different changes over time
