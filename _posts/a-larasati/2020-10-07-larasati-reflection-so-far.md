title: "On Class So Far"

Before I know it, it was already October. Looking back at the material we've covered so far, I realized we've covered quite a lot and that there is still more to go. I think I got lucky this time because I happen to be in a relationship with someone who works as a software engineer, so I essentially have in-person troubleshooting help on-demand, but I knew that this is still something I have to learn and do on my own. 

I think I'm mostly worried at the number of tools in the toolbox. Obviously you need tools in the toolbox, but at the moment it feels like I have so much that I'm starting to forget what I already have and how to use them. I still get a little scared when I have to approach a new problem to solve, especially if it's under pressure or time constraints (I would definitely fail technical interviews if I ever have one...). I started doing Hacker Rank just to keep those basic skills in my head, but I also worry that I won't be able to think beyond the basics.

I still am curious at how to use Python as a tool for research and data management. I can see how what we've got is good for what we're doing, but I'm having a harder time seeing how I can use all of this out of the context of creating a turtle game.
