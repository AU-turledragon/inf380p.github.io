### On Turtlehacks
I think for the this Turtlehacks exercise, I wanted to really get a feel for using the `def` function because Exercise 4 left me quite stumped, even though I managed to (mostly) complete it.

I looked up some documentation on Turtle, and those were very helpful-though maybe slightly overwhelming-in showing me just how many things I can make the turtles do, specifically from [here.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#module-turtle) But because my focus was mostly on getting used to the `def` function, I didn't really dive too deep into the nitty gritty of what I can do with the other Turtle commands.

I copied the base code from this logical turtle Trinket from last week to get me started:

I ended up modifying the code a little bit to better suit the `def` function. I don't think I had a super 'a-ha!' moment with this exercise, but I definitely feel a little more comfortable with using `def`. I think my biggest struggle is the logical parts contained within the different `def` functions and actually remembering to type in the function I just defined in order to make the code actually run. Logical statements still trip me up, especially those pesky colons and indents, and I still get error messages here and there while I work through writing the code, but Googling things here and there has definitely helped me figure things out as I go. 

Here's my final Trinket for the Turtlehacks exercise. I might go in and spruce it up some more in the future.

###On week 3
Week 3 was all online, and I think overall it went relatively well. I've written a little bit about the in-class exercise that we did, but essentially, I struggled with the whole 'diving in head-first' thing that coding really requires, and even while working through these exercises I really couldn't stop myself from having to look into things before actually using it. Fear of the error message is quite real, especially since I'm just used to associating 'error' and red with 'you did a bad thing and you should've entered everything correctly the first time.' Even with the take-home exercises I was still struggling to not get too wrapped up in the text and to just get going with *something.* I guess my frustrations are mostly related to my own inability to get out of my headspace rabbit hole; it just doesn't come naturally to me.
