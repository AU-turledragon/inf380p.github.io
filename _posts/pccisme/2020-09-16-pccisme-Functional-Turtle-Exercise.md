Here's my functional turtle exercise:

My reflection:
It's like the upgraded version of my Turtlehacks. I want my turtle can continue drawing from its current position instead of starting from (0, 0). I checked the official document of the turtle and found "turtle.pos()" and "turtle.setposition()" can be helpful for my goal. Also, I spent a couple of minutes figuring out how to allow the user to input the desired position for the first time and stop asking once we already save the current position.
