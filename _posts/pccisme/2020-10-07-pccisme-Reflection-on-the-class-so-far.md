## Reflection:
I am honored to take this course, because this course and the professor gave me a perfect opportunity to review and strengthen my basic concepts of Python. For example, in the process of cleaning data, I often use slice, but I did not expect that even if the range exceeds the length of the string, there will be no error.

```Python
string = "Reflection"
print(string[-100:-3]) #It will print "Reflect" without any error messages
```

In this course, we use Python to learn a lot of computer science knowledge. This semester, because of the need for a course project, I have to learn a new language: Swift. Although I pointed out at the beginning of the semester, in my experience, learning Python as my first language led to some of my weak programming concepts. But in the process of learning Swift, I found that as a new language, Swift seems to refer to many advantages from Python and incorporate these advantages into Swift, such as very similar approaches to using array and dictionary. Based on my knowledge of python, it makes me learn Swift more quickly. I think Python is a great language. It's not the most perfect language, but its simplicity is something everyone can definitely feel.

### Python
```Python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
nums.append(6) #add a number to nums
for i in nums:
  print(i) #iteration
nums[1] = 7 #update value
```

### Swift
```Swift
var nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
nums.append(6)
for i in nums {
  print(i)
}
nums[1] = 7
```

In most cases, I still use Stack Overflow to help me solve problems, and I spent more time reading the threads this semester. In my observation, writing a good question is the most important factor in a highly valuable discussion thread. Moreover, I think the most difficult discussion thread to read is that the person who asks the question did not provide enough code so that all respondents must answer the question under certain assumptions.
