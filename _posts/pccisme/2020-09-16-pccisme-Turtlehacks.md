## Relections:
I applied what we've learned in the class, and tried to make a reasonable function. Many parts are what I wanted to do from the beginning. Then, I thought joining a variable "times" can make the function being a little more creative and flexible. Last, I am not sure the way I make "the switch" is right. It works in this program, but I am wondering if there are more ways to design "the switch".
