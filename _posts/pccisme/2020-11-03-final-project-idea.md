## My Final Project Idea

I have always wanted to make a news application of my own. 

Currently, more news applications recommend to readers by marking or ranking popular articles. In my initial idea, I hope to see the trending keywords of today's news at a glance. I think using trending keywords with one or two news items can summarize today's news very briefly. I want to use this final project to create the news application. So, this will be a data analysis project.

I hope to get news information and content through news APIs on the market. In my research, I saw that Bing News, Bloomberg, New York Times, etc. all provide free news APIs. In addition, I also found one called "News Api "Under a certain amount of traffic, developers can use their API to obtain news information in JSON format, including news agencies, authors, titles, content, and other information. To get trending keywords, I would like to extract news headlines, record the number of words in each keyword in a dictionary, and exclude some meaningless words, such as "A/An", "The", and "is/are". I will use the above methods to find keyword trends and expect to present them to users visually.

## Initial Work Plan
- [ ] Compare different options and select the API I want to use in my project
- [ ] Fetch news data in JSON format
- [ ] Get the titles and put every keywords in dictionary and count them
- [ ] Desgin an UI to show the result
- [ ] Work on building some data visualizations
- [ ] The applcation can work automatically update data every day
- [ ] Advanced features!
