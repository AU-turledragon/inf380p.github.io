## How did it go?

Because I am very interested in data visualization, and this semester I have designed several dashboards in my part-time job. Therefore, I participated in an online event organized by Tableau and the topic is "Inspiring change with data visualization". The keynote speaker Mr. Steve Wexler shared how to design charts and use them to communicate information with your audience effectively. In the Q&A session, people asked questions, and according to his work experience, he answered how he would face these issues.

## What did you learn?
In his speech, there is one thing I see very important for me. He mentioned that people should not focus on designing those very complicated charts, those simple and clear charts should be the focus of our learning. Because these clear charts are the best way to achieve the purpose of data visualization: helping users understand the data in a short time.

## Would you find value in this kind of event after class?
I rarely participated in events like this before, but I found these events to be very valuable. From this Tableau event, in addition to the content of the speaker’s speech, I learned a lot from the questions from other participants. Some of the questions are out of my mind, but those definitely cannot be ignored.

## How was the experience different from your expectations?
In the process of participating, one thing was unexpected for me. Participants asked questions very enthusiastically, and I could feel that most of the questions were prepared. In this event, basically, we can only see the speaker’s screen and him from his webcam, and the participants cannot see each other. So, I did not expect a lot of interactions.

## Could you see yourself becoming a member of a professional community like this in the future?
Of course! When designing a dashboard, I think it’s important to receive feedback. I readjust my dashboard based on the feedback, and the dashboard does get better and better. Therefore, I hope that in the future, I will have the opportunity to be the keynote speaker to share my works and experience. By hearing the questions and feedback from participants, I firmly believe that I will gain more valuable experience.
