## Reflection
First of all, I think the process of developing this game is very interesting. I spent an afternoon to meet the basic requirements. After that, I played the game every two days and tried to improve some places. As time goes on, the playability of the game is getting better.

During the development process, I gradually learned that it is important to write highly readable code. After a period of time, I will not be so familiar with the logic of the code. If the readability of the code is low, I have to spend a lot of time re-understanding the logic every time. In addition, I also realize the importance of writing comments. In addition to helping others understand my code, in the process of writing comments, it is also an opportunity to reorganize the code so that the code can appear to have a clear structure.

Moreover, I think I can understand why the professor wants us to develop this project alone. This opportunity gives every student to try independent development. But during the process, I thought that it would be better if I could develop with one or two team members. There are a lot of features that I would like to discuss with others. For example, I always feel that I have no idea about the part that how to interact with the user. I would like to hear other people's thoughts.

Finally, I accidentally found that I am not familiar the rules of Black Jack. I read the project requirements multiple times and referred to Wikipedia. It seems that the rules are not the same as what in my mind. But trying to understand task requirements and writing runnable code are the challenges which I learned most from.
