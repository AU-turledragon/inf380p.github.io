#Reflection
Sometimes mistakes will happen on calculation of the angles. For example, when I do the draw a star questions, I thought the angle turtle should turn is 180 * (side - 2). But it turns out to be the sum angle of a star is 180 and the angle it should turn is just 180 - (180 / 5). Though these are all simple calculations, but sometimes recklessness will cause mistakes.
I encountered some syntax errors when using two for loops and if/else conditions. Mistakes will happen when putting instructions such as turtle.color & turtle.start_fill(). If put the color instruction in wrong syntax, that color will not even show when drawing figures. Also, though I can draw different figures with different colors by changing parameters frequently 
and call several method functions, however, I couldn't think of how to pick color randomly in the for loops. Because one time method call will only give one time color changed. So I'm wondering if there's any way to change color randomly in the for loop with some object methods?
