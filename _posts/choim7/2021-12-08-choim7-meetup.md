The python meet up I attended was the one held on Dec 8th and it was held through the Zoom. It went well. The meeting starts with guests sharing several hiring 
info posted by companies such as Bank of America and other url links link to hiring info posted by small companies. I think such sharing activity is very helpful 
because it makes more opportunites for pythoners to find a good job in the future. The meeting mainly introduced ROS which is robot operating system, what ROS can 
do, what's the development history of ROS, common ROS packages, etc. 

This is the first time I've heard about the robot operating system and there were a lot of unfamiliar terms in the powperpoint 
provided by the speaker Greg Freeman.But it looks very interesting to me, because it leads me to a new world of tech. I 
learned the history of ROS. So there were ROS 1 of which the launch files is xml, the build system is catkin, with no realtime support and ROS 2 of which the lauch 
file is python, the build system is colcon, and with realtime support. Also, there were Nav2 and Movelt2 which can help to realize different funtionalities such 
as, stereo vision, 2D lidar, monocular vision by Nav2, and pick and place applications, hand-eye calibration, collision checking and avoidance, etc. To be honesty, 
it was quite hard for me to follow all these contents, so I may need to google a lot to understand the contents further. All in all, it was really exciting to 
learn these contents I've never known. 

Before this meeting, I didn't realize such meeting is so helpful in the way that it shares open resources and talks about new things in tech area. 
I think if I want to learn new contents, I have to pay for the online classes provided by Udemy or Coursera. But the meeting gives me a chance in learning new 
contents and it's free. I would really love to attend such python meetings in the future and I hope I can make progress in my python coding quickly so that one day,
I will be able to immersively join in the talk and catch up with the discussions people have.
