#I would like to make a Turtle game for my final project. I want to make it as a super mario adventure with a character that can jump 
and make other actions to avoid blocks or enemies. I think I should look through more Turtle methods for completing my final project. 
I will go through the Turtle instructions on Python website at first and go to the Pygames to see what interesting elements I can add to my project:)
