Since last class I have created my main turtle that will be controlled by the user. It moves forward and backward with the up and down arrow keys and changes its angle by 90 degrees with the left and right arrows. I have drawn my level one maze. I created a module that contains the first maze function and will have functions for all three mazes eventually. I have also created a turtle in a separate module that draws the maze outline and basic maze obstacles that I imported into the mazes.py. I have written the text for the level and score counts, as well as a timer. I created the timer in a separate module called timer. The code below displays what I have so far.

I have completed my initial goals for week one, which were to create my background, turtle, and write the code to make the turtle move around the screen. Originally next week, I wanted to write the code that established each level and make the turtle move faster for each level, as well as beginning the mazes. Now, for the next week, I now want to figure out how to iterate through my levels, and I want to create my objects for my coins. I also no longer want the turtle to move faster in each level as I stated in my original project idea. In the week after I want to write the code to update the score and level counters. I still want to have my code completed by December 6 so that I have enough time before the project is due for any final debugging and to complete any work left on the reflection. 

The one major task I have ahead is figuring out how to go from level to level. I am currently not sure how to write the code so that once a level is completed, it will go to the next and so on. I also need to figure out how to update the counters for my levels and my points. Additionally, an obstacle is figuring out how to restart a level if the timer hits the maximum amount of time. I also need to write the code that will create the coins the turtle will collect and the code that will cause a level to fail if the main turtle intersects with the maze. I do believe my milestones for the next weeks are appropriate in order to complete the project. My first milestone in my original plan, however, was not ambitious enough and I was able to complete more than I expected.
