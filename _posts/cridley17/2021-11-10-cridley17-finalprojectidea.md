title: "Claire's Final Project Idea and Work Plan"
---

For my final project, I will make a turtle game. Each level will include a maze the turtle must travel through and collect all coins within to gain points in a certain amount of time. A level can only be cleared if the turtle collects a certain amount of coins. A level will fail if the turtle touches the edge of the maze, doesn’t reach the end of the maze, or the turtle doesn’t collect enough coins in the time allotted. Each of the levels will have both a shorter amount of time to complete and a more complex maze for the turtle to traverse around. The turtle will also move quicker in each level. A player wins once level three is completed. The turtle will be controlled using the arrow keys.

In the first week of working on the project, I want to create my background, turtle, and write the code to make the turtle move around the screen. For week two I want the code that establishes each level of the game and ensures the turtle moves at a higher speed in each level. I also want to begin creating the lines of the maze I want the turtle to move around for each level. For week three I want to have all my mazes created for each level and I want to begin placing coins within the level while also creating the score counter and timer. Overall, I aim to have all the code completed by December 6, so that I have a few days before the project is due to do any final debugging and complete any work left on the reflection.
