In the code below, a new turtle class is created named PinkTurtle.

The class `PinkTurtle` creates a pink turtle that is located at (50,50). It also contains the method `draw_pentagon`, which faces the turtle to 110 degrees so that the pentagon's points face the top of then screen, and then uses a for loop to create the shape of a pentagon and fills it with custom_color as a parameter.  

Something that hindered me while writing this code is that I am unsure of what instantiate means in the directions. I tried consulting Runestone and other sources, but this vocabulary word was still rather unclear. I am not sure if I’ve done the assignment fully because of my misunderstanding of this concept. 

Overall, I found that creating a new class and defining a new method within the class to be relatively straightforward. One thing I initially needed to remember was to initialize self, and after that point creating the method was clear-cut. I also found that I remembered fairly well from last week’s material about the basics of using turtles and did not feel any confusion besides what I mentioned above.
