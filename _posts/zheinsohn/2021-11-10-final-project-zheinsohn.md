My final project idea is to create a data analysis tool: a crossword dictionary tool that can be used to both solve and help create crossword puzzles. Through a combination of user input, regex, and importing an English language dictionary, the tool will allow users to return words with a specific pattern of letters, including letter placement and word length. Each word in the dictionary will be assigned a numerical score corresponding to how often they appear in a sample size of premade crossword puzzles.

The words will return in the order of most to least common, ideally with a visual representation of the numerical score (like a row of asterisks or some other symbol). The tool should allow users to not only specify letter pattern, but also a specific "commonality score", which will aid in the creation of crosswords. If a user wants to make a more difficult crossword, they can ask for words with a lower commonality score.

My Final Project Plan:
  1. Locate at least two data files: A simple English language dictionary and a data file of a to-be-determined number of the words that most often appear in crosswords.
  2. Assign "commonality score" to the dictionary words and create main data file.
  3. Write and test regex code to successfully return words with a particular pattern and score.
  4. Plan user interface for both user input and visual returns. Ideally, I would love for this to be more than the basic user input text box and screen if possible, but I want to ensure that the user is able to input a request and the results return properly.
  5. Test on crossword puzzle solving and create a simple puzzle using this tool.

I think making the user interface that is both easy and pleasant to use and have the returned results have a visual indicator of how common they are will be the most difficult and time-consuming part of the project. I am interested in exploring the option of potentially using a GUI for the user input part of the program if it would be possible, both generally and in the time frame allotted for completion.
