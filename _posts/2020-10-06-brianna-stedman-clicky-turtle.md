Here is an embed of the clicky turtle I have been working on.

I'm remixing my Turtle Treasure Hunt game to accept click events instead of typing in coordinates! However, I'm still having trouble creating a bigger range to make the game a little easier, because right now you have to click on the exact coordinate. At one point I would like to have the user input whether they would like to play Easy, Medium, or Hard mode, and change the range (or the margin of error, I suppose) for the trasure coordinates based off that answer. It's still fun to make my turtle run around the whole screen even if I'm not able to click on the treasure coordinates, though! I'm starting to think ahead as to what I'm capable of for the final project and I might just continue working on this to make it more like an actual game.
