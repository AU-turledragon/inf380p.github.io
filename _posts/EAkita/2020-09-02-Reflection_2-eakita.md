I enjoyed the introductions in class in the second class, and I liked the energy and the vibe of the class. This was my first in-person class, since I joined the course late.

Also, going through the exercises from the first week was a good refresher for me, since I was now catching up. 

Finally, I didn’t fully understand how to use Github and was still confused as to how to get that to work, so I’m still figuring that out.
