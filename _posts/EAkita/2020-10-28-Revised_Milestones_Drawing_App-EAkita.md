Reflection
I edited my milestones to fit the amount of time that I had, and what I could do within that timeline.
I started out by setting time blocks. I realized that I was overly ambitious in what I wanted to do. 
So with the realistic timeblocks, I had to prioritize and fit in what I could do. 
The biggest things that I’m learning with this class and with everything else is time management when writing code. Also that a program is never truly finished, especially when you’re building something from a creative standpoint. Finally, I can always add an extra feature, but the core of the program has to be designed first, within the time frame. 	

The biggest thing for me was that I had to play with the cordinate points to get the buttons right on the screen. 
My spirograph function isn't working, so I'll have to fix that spirograph didn’t work out 


Fix the clicky screen
add star
Add the ability to change the colors
