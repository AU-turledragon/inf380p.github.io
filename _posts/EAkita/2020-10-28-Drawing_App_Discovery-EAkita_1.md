**Reflection**
I edited my milestones to fit the amount of time that I had, and what I could do within that timeline. I started out by setting time blocks. I realized that I was overly ambitious in what I wanted to do. So with the realistic timeblocks, I had to prioritize and fit in what I could do. The biggest things that I’m learning with this class and with everything else is time management when writing code. Also that a program is never truly finished, especially when you’re building something from a creative standpoint. Finally, I can always add an extra feature, but the core of the program has to be designed first, within the time frame.

The biggest thing for me was that I had to play with the cordinate points to get the buttons right on the screen. Ichanged this to be a disciovery drawing app. It has a few glitches here and there for my spirograph function.
