**Reflection**
My focus over the last week was to create 3D graphics with python. I was successful in creating a cuboid and a sphere. The cuboid was basically positioning the squares correctly. However, the major road block was figuring out the sphere; this was much more involving. I resulted to using polar cordinates and playing around with equation of a circle and a sphere and I got it figured out as shown in the 
Thus, initial milestone #1 done. 

Next Step
The next step will be to figure out how to use the concept fo 3D rendering for my spirogram (initial milestone #2). Overall, I think my milestones are ambitious enough. I should have this ready for class on Nov. 18th. 

Stretch Goal
A stretch goal is to have 2 environments this game can be played in:
#1 In space, where the Physics is relaxed due to microgravity environment (spheres can fall in any direction)
#2 on earth, where the falling of the spheres is goverened by the laws of gravity (I'm thinking this might be more difficult, that's why it's a stretch goal; I might have to describe object inertia, maybe even prescribe random parabolic paths...)

Also, I think I can keep to my plan quite well.
