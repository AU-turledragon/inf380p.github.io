**3D spiral slicing game**
I have always been fascinated with simple 3D graphics, but never quite knew how to create them. Earlier in this course, I created a Spirograph with simple python code. When this assignment was given, I thought, I could actually make this Spirograph a 3D volume and try to make it fall from the top of the screen to the bottom. Then I could have a user slice through it and it will fall apart, just like a slicking fruit game. This is what I will attempt to do in this project. 

**Milestones**
1. Figure out how to do 3D graphics with python. This will involve some math: vectors, 3D matrices etc. and I started doing a bit of reading on this.
2. Figure out how to do a 3D rendering of the spirogram
3. Figure out how to move the spirogram from the top of the screen, downwards
4. Figure out how to “cut” or “slice” the volume
5. Figure out how the volumes will fall, and what is considered “successful” and what is a “failure”
6. Figure out how to score the game, and keep track of the score
7. Add a restart button to reinitialize the game.
