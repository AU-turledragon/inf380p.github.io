**Reflection**

Working on this assignment was very interesting. I knew right away that I didn't want to work on the Blackjack app so I selected the Drawing app by default. Creating the milestones made me think about the highlevel, elements that I wanted to have in my app. I thought back about when I was a kid using the Paint MS Windows app, and included things from that app I felt I could program in two weeks. My partner (Shweta) was also super helpful since she was doing the same project too.
