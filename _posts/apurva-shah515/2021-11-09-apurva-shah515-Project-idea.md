# Project Idea

For my final project, I want to complete a data analysis project on data related to an area of interest of mine, livestreaming. In particular, I want to complete some data analysis on data from twitch streamers, such as their follower counts, hours streamed, watchtime, language and more. So far I have found two separate kaggle datasets for this project, which do contain some overlapping data but there are some differences. I believe it will be beneficial to include both in the final trinket for this project. 

In terms of data analysis, the datasets will allow me to find some summary statistics, as well as creating and printing lists of the information. I will also be able to provide histograms or visualizations of the data for some parts of the dataset, such as which languages or categories streamers primarily used during the chosen time period, or whether or not a given streamer is flagged as being mature content/partnered with Twitch. These can all be summarised as individual functions so a user that wishes to pull out certain information from this dataset as it is updated may do so freely. 

The two Kaggle datasets: \
[Top 1000 twitch streamers of 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/aayushmishra1512/twitchdata "Top Streamers on Twitch Kaggle")  - The data in this dataset was scraped from a third-party website which displays twitch-related statistics\
[Top 8800 twitch streamers data of 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/girlazo/top-8800-twitch-streamers "Top 8800 Twitch Streamers") - The data in this dataset was collected using the Twitch API

I believe this will be an interesting project, and given my interest in the social media/digital entertainment space, this project is one I am quite passionate about. 

# My work plan

1. Clean the data if necessary and merge the two files into a third data file for use in this program
2. Write code for pulling out summary statistics - various averages for different categories
3. Write code for graphical representations (histograms, pie charts etc.) for non-numerical categories
4. Add dictionaries for storing summary statistics
5. Define functions for each of these methods
6. Add help text, comments and instructions for how to use this program
7. Ensure the program is compatible with Trinket's console for interactability
8. Incorporate my defined functions and methods into a custom module
