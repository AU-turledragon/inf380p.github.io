# Update and Reflection

In my previous post, I had created a new plan for approaching my project and creating visualizations and drawing out summary statistics over the entire dataset that I was working with. At this point in my project, I am pretty pleased with how much I have achieved in terms of creating callable functions for a user to see some visualizations and draw out summary information from the dataset as a whole. 

In my modified work plan from the last update two weeks ago, I had initially planned to create some functions and then improve my initial UI sketch to reflect these functions before adding functions for visualizations. I opted to instead create the functions for the visualizations and then recreate my interface sketch as a whole. I have been able to keep to my plan, and I believe that I am on track for completing my project by next week. I took the opportunity to explore some new visualizations, and there is room for extension in exploring the correlation between different data columns in my file, time permitting. 

As from the last class before Thanksgiving, I opted to start a new Trinket which housed my functions for data analysis. I can then import this into the Trinket with my interactive menu once the interface has been fleshed out. To this end, the trinket included in this post is a snapshot of my Functions rather than a snapshot of the overall Project Interface, file and Functions module. 

# My Initial Work Plan
1. Clean the data if necessary and merge the two files into a third data file for use in this program
2. Write code for pulling out summary statistics - various averages for different categories
3. Write code for graphical representations (histograms, pie charts etc.) for non-numerical categories
4. Add dictionaries for storing summary statistics
5. Define functions for each of these methods
6. Add help text, comments and instructions for how to use this program
7. Ensure the program is compatible with Trinketâ€™s console for interactability
8. Incorporate my defined functions and methods into a custom module

# Modified Work Plan
1. [x] Clean the data
2. [ ] Draft a mostly complete user interface sketch
3. [x] Define functions for data visualizations - histogram and pie chart for the non-numerical categories
4. [x] Define functions and menu option for allowing the user to see the data - most viewed, most viewers gained etc.
5. [x] Incorporate a dictionary for the statistics, so the user can simply look up the dictionary value rather than parse the whole text file
6. [ ] Add help text, comments and instructions on how to use the program

I am currently in the process of revisiting my earlier UI sketch to create the menu options for my data analysis functions, and so I am jumping back to complete the menu options before revisiting my overall interface and the help sections. 

# Plan for next week

As the upcoming week is the last week of the semester, the plan is to get the interface and menu system as complete as possible before revisiting any extension analysis tasks I wanted to include for myself. Particularly with the improved sketch that was shown in class before, this should be more than achievable. This has been an interesting analysis project!
