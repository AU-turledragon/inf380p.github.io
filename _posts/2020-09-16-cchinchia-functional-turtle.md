## Relection:
I have two functions on my functional turtle. Users can click on the screen to change the background color, and type in the console to make the turtle draw graphs. I learned to name different turtles to make multiple functions work at the same time. For example, when the turtle is drawing the graph, the background color is still changeable when clicking on the screen.
