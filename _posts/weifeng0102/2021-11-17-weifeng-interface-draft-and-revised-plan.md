# revised idea and interface draft
  
The earliest plan I wanted was to draw a more interesting pattern with turtle, but after taking a few lessons and looking up some turtle designs on the Internet, I thought the project I originally planned was too boring, and I hope to make a simple turtle game. .
But my skills are limited, so at the beginning of the project, I couldn't immediately conceive what this little game would look like. So the way I hope to accomplish this is to reverse the turtle abilities I need to use through the requirements of the final project, consider separately what elements these turtle abilities can serve in this small game, and make multiple attempts, and finally use these elements to combine Into the final game.
For example, external data files can be game characters or decorative elements.
For Dictionaries, it can be used to store the shape and color of the corresponding element.
```
color = {‘a’: “red”, ‘b’: “blue”, ‘c’: “green”}
shape = {‘a’: “square”, ‘b’: “triangle”, ‘c’: “pentagon”}
```
  
# revised work plan
The previous plan was too crude, just to list the approximate weekly work. But my project process is based on exploration, so it is difficult to list specific details in the initial stage. The revised plan mainly sets the goals of each milestone:
* Before Nov 20, determine what element each ability required by the job corresponds to in the final turtle game
* Before Nov 24, determine the external files that need to be used and how to use them in the game
* Before Nov 30, through exploration to determine the rules of the game and how to interact
* After Nov 30, continue to adjust and improve the code.
