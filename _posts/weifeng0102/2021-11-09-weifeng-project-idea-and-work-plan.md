I hope to do the turtle project as a final project. In order to ensure that I really learn the various drawing skills of turtles, I hope to use the abilities of turtles as much as possible.
These capabilities include:
Lines and circles
Draw regular graphics with loops
Use recursion to draw regular and complex graphics (this part is self-study on the Internet)
Use class to define standard graphics for easy calling
I plan to complete the final project in the next three weeks:
Determine the graphics to be drawn and the turtle abilities that need to be used in the first week.
In the second week, learn and be familiar with all the turtle abilities, try to draw the desired graphics while trying.
Adjust and improve in the third week and produce the final results, sum up the reflection experience.
