Here in my logical turtle exercise:

For this quick in class exercise, I had to practice starting right away rather than overthinking what I wanted to write. I am still in the habit of wanting to think things through and wanting to write everything correctly. In order to satisfy all the requirements, but still make it simple, I wanted to let the user choose the shape and color of Tina the Turtle. I refered back to the very first in class assignment where we learned about shapes. I only felt confident about a square and a circle, but perhaps in the future with more knowledge and confidence, I would allow for more shapes to be requested. Lastly, I tried to have "except" in the end for the user in case they typed something other than a circle or square, but I could not figure it out. I hope to become more comfortable experimenting with "try" and "except" in the future.
