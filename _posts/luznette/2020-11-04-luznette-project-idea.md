title: "Janette's Final Project Idea and Work Plan"

For the final project, I am hoping to expand a previous assingment.

In this version, Tina the Turtle has the task of jumping over hurdles in order to get to the goal. 

For the final project, I initially wanted to create a game where you have to take care of a pet through feeding and playing with them. However, I then realized that the game needed to have three levels that increase in difficulty as well as a point where the player "wins". I was then reminded about a previous assignment, and thought I could combine the two games. For now, I am thinking that I could have the player adopt a pet, name the pet, and work towards earning coins to buy items for their pet. In order to keep the pet happy, the player must feed and play with their pet. In order to earn coins, the player will be moved through levels of hurdles that increase in difficulty. The player must jump over the hudles and make it to the goal to earn the most coins.  If this idea is too complicated, then I will remove the aspect of the pet. The help dialog would remind the players how to move over hurdles, and the ultimate goals. The player wins when it gets through all three levels and will be able to spend their coins. 

Some current milestones that have:
[] Make a visual representation of how I see the game looking/written
[] Create classes for different types of pets
[] Implement images to the code
[] Define functions
[] Comment out code
