I did not have as much time this week to dedicate to advancing my code, so instead I focused on making sure that all the requirements from the assignment are taken care of. I still have a very hard time getting started without some sort of plan or rough structure. Although I technically finished my first milestone, at first I was a bit dissapointed that I did not advance my code. However, planning all the requirements took some time and I know I will save time once I start writing my code since I now have an idea of how the code will go. I am sure some things might change as I advance, but having a rough sketch of the the goal is incredibly helpful for me. 

As far as roadblocks, I can imagine some of my plans falling through if I cannot figure out how to execute them. Some might be too ambitious, but I think the majority of them I are within reach. The way I can prevent this is to try to come to class and office hours ready with any questions/problems.

I would say my problem right now is execution. I should have gotten started right away even if it meant not executing something properly. That is something that I have been trying to improve the entire semester.

Here is my code that is the same from last week:

Here are my previous milestones (new milestones in bold):
- [x] Make a visual representation of how I see the game looking/written 
- [] **Create level 1**
- [] **Create level 2**
- [] **Create level 3**
- [] **Make help dialog**
- [] **Be able to click on help dialog at any point in the game**
- [] Create classes for different types of pets 
- [] Implement images/**pet** to the code 
- [] **Have score and current level in a top corner**
- [] **Have a completed screen for level 1**
- [] **Have a completed screen for level 2**
- [] **Have a win screen for level 3**
- [] Define functions 
- [] Comment out code

For now, here are my rough ideas:
**External Data Files**
* Instructions for the game/welcome message
**Dictionary**
* To keep scores?
**Custom Modules**
* Instructions for the three levels
* The levels themselves
**Definite Loops**
* To go in and out of levels
**Custom Functions**
* Allow characters to move
* Allow to click pet for help dialog
**Custom Classes**
* Be able to customize the pet? 
**Key and Click Events**
* Arrows to move player
* Click the pet to get the help dialog
**Help Dialog Present at All Times**
* Click on pet for level instructions ("Must collect ____ to move on to the next level")
**Display score/level**
* Score and level will be displayed on the corner of the game
**Have At Least 3 Levels**
1. Level that has already been made, perhaps just improve some of the "graphics"
2. Have the hurdles move
3. Have the screen move and have new hurdles pop up?
**A 'Win' Screen**
* The player will have to collect a certain amount of treats/coins
**Interative Interface**
* Be able to play if they do not get the amount of coins that are needed to go to the next level
**Custom Images**
*The pet itself or perhaps use the image as a background for the game*
