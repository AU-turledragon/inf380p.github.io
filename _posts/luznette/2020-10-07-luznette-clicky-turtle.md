For this assignment, I wanted to create a game where the user would have Tina jump over hurdles and make it to the goal to win. If they ran into a hurdle, the game would stop and ask the user if they wanted to try again. A "yes" or "no" message would pop up, and the user would click on either option to continue or end the game. If they won, they were met with the ```congratulate``` imported animation. The user would move Tina with the left and right arrow keys, change Tina's color with the up and down arrow keys, and use the space bar to jump over the hurdles. Tina is able to change colors by importing ```random```. I found the part of the assignment that delt with keys a lot easier than clicks. I managed to create boundaries where tina would fail if it hit the hurdle. I was not able to figure out how to make the click functions work for a particular section of the screen. For now, once the yes and no messages are up, there is no way to play again or end the game. 

While I was not able to figure out everything for this assignment, I gained confidence since I was able to write a lot more functions this time without having to check back on my notes and books chapters as much as I have before. The hardest part of these free assignments is having to create something from scratch, I tend to have trouble coming up with creative ideas. I am hoping that by seeing my classmates' work I will gain inspiration for future projects!
