I did not make as much progress as I would have liked, but I got a bit stuck while trying to add images to my game. Initially, I figured this would be the finishing touches of the game, but then I realized that I would have a better time vizualizing the game if I added the images, set up the welcome screen, and then proceeded to work on the levels. When the images were not uploading correctly (as they are in this version of the game, they are sideways) I got stuck. I spent a lot of my time trying to figure out how to manilpuate the images rather than just changing the original file. After talking with my group partners, I realized (again) that I was using the wrong version of python within trinket, which is probably why my images are not being imported correctly. My next milestone that I hope to work during this class time is to move over my game to a either python 3 or pygame. 

During our conversation, we also talked about the logistics behind pulling up the help screen whenever it is called by the user. We figured that in order for that to happen, the game would have to "pause" so that the help screen can come up without the entire game being erased. In order words, trying to figure out how to call the help screen without losing place in the game. Brittany found this link which will be helpful and I will spend class time exploring: https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html

My milestones for this class:
- [] Transition current code into python 3 or pygame
- [] Write up the instructions/help screen
- [] Figure out how many trurtles will be needed throughout the game (currently have 3)
