I had begun to make progress on my program, but I quickly realized I would not be able to continue on python 3. This week I could not dedicate as much time, so I purchased a plan to be able to save the program on pygame. It has been a bit difficult to set aside time for this porject since I have had other multiple deadlines these past few weeks, but luckily those projects are done and I can dedicate the next week and a half to finishing this program.

I still need to transfer and fix the code so that it can work on pygame, and so that will be my goal for the class. Once I am able to run the program that I had before without any errrors, I can continue with the rest of my milestones:

[x] Make a visual representation of how I see the game looking/written
[X] Create level 1
[] Create level 2
[] Create level 3
[] Make help dialog
[] Be able to click on help dialog at any point in the game
[] Create classes for different types of pets
[X] Implement images/pet to the code
[] Have score and current level in a top corner
[] Have a completed screen for level 1
[] Have a completed screen for level 2
[] Have a win screen for level 3
[] Define functions
[] Comment out code
