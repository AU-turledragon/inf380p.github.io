title: "Janette's Functional Turtle Exercise"

This assignment was tricky only because I had to find a previous turtle I made that had repetitive code, but also didn't change it all the much. They both still do the same thing, just broke it down into three parts and into three ```def```, and then calling the statements at the end. Hopefully, this would make it easier if I were to write longer code and need to call the circles, the background, or the message.
