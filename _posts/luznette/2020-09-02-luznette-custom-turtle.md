After revisting the basics of github, I feel a bit more comfortable using the site. Especially knowing that my classmates will give my posts a second look in order to make sure I did not make any mistakes. It is also great to know that we can utilize code blocks and images to explain our procress better. I was having trouble explaining my roadblocks in the previous reflection.

Example of a code block:
```
# input functions
turtle_color = input("What color should Tina be?")
background_color = input("What color should the background be?")
```
