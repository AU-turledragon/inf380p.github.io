title: "Janette's First Reflection"
---
I was a bit nervous when I first signed up for this class since programming is completely new to me. I've worked in libraries where programming is important, and have attended workshops, but I always found myself never fully understanding what those around me discussed. I was also not entirely sure what programming could be used for. In my mind, it was exclusively reserved for video games and app building. When we began working on multiple exercises on the first day, I found myself feeling frustrated for not understanding a concept right away. In my academic career, I am used to working through issues and questions through conversations in seminar settings. If I don't understand a certain aspect of a theory, I have the opportunity to sit back and hear classmates and professors explain their understanding. Having to work on the single problem over and over again is something that is out of my comfort zone. However, I am hoping that programming will help me become comfortable with making mistakes. After this week, I feel a lot more confident. While I did not always understand the readings, they became a lot more clear as I worked through the exercises. I realized that there is a lot of overlap from what I have learned in previous classes about metadata, databases, etc. This definitely made it less intimidating.
