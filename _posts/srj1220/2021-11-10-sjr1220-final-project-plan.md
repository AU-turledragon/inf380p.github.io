I plan on making a turtle game for my final project.

I would like to make a game where a turtle (or two) runs around on a background and needs to eat enough food scattered around in order to advance to the next level. I think that I would also like to add things for the player to have to avoid, like "bad" food or obstacles, that might reduce points or result in a game over, depending on the item hit.
I think that in order to increase difficulty for each new level, I could add new or more items to avoid into the background or create a timed aspect to the game that decreases with each level.
This is modeled loosely after a game that I used to play a lot online of dogs gathering food in a backyard, so I have a pretty good idea of what the game needs to be able to do in order to function.
* I need to make "win" and "try again" screens (maybe have the turtle draw a word?)
* as well as a help/instructions screen
* learn how to make a turtle react to key presses (and if I decide to do a two-turtle stage, have one react to arrow keys and the other WASD)
* use my own graphics for obects (learn how/if I can import them? It would be fun to have the "good" food be food(s) turtles can eat, like apples, and the "bad" food be things like candy bars)

I think that since the levels build on each other, I should be able to code one level and then modify it as I need for the others. The tricky parts seem to be making "screens" for win/lose and help, as well as advancing to the next level, since I don't know how I will do those yet, and they are required for the game to function. I'm not sure on specific dates, as I'm not sure what the workload for each of these steps will be, but I would like to be done with the project around Dec 5th, so that I can then focus on writing my reflection.
