title: "Sarah's Final Project Update"

I had a rough couple of weeks, but after several hours of focused work, I was able to get through most of my goals for my game. I am perhaps not as far along as I expect other students may be, but I am still reasonably confident that I will be able to complete the rest of my goals (and in doing so, meet the requirements for the project).
The last time I checked in (two weeks ago), I only had a version of the game where two turtles could run around on the screen.
Today, I have a version where I have:
* a "fence" buffer around the edges of the screen to keep the turtle inside the playing area
* "food" that triggers the score to be increased when touched by the turtle
* a win screen that triggers after the score reaches a certain number
* "poison" that triggers a lose screen when touched by the turtle
Unfortunately, I had to remove the second player turtle while I was working, because it just got to be too confusing for me. I have a few goals left, and one of my "stretch goals" is to reintroduce the 2nd player turtle.
The rest of my goals are:
* build the 2nd and 3rd levels (using the objects I already have and increasing difficulty by speeding up the turtle)
* trigger the 2nd and 3rd levels after reaching certain scores
* add custom graphics for the turtle food
* add help dialog
* allow players to replay the game
* create a score counter on the turtle screen
* create more obstacles inside the play area for the harder levels (STRETCH GOAL)
* reintroduce the 2nd player turtle (STRETCH GOAL)
I think that my goals are plenty ambitious enough, especially since it's taken me this long to get this much to work. I worked for hours trying to get the food to trigger anything, and really struggled with it. I have a bunch of failed drafts where I tried to set up a live counter on the screen, as well, but right now it just prints the score because that's all I could manage to do.
I'm having a lot of problems getting things to work, and I think it's because I'm still confused by a lot of aspects of Python, so I don't always understand the help I can find online. I normally end up having to try 5 or more different options to get one thing to work and then I by the time I get that to work I am exhausted and frustrated.
I have been having a rouch time in my personal life recently, and I also just started a new job on top of finals for other classes so I am feeling a little overwhelmed. Because I know I will get frustrated with this project I tend to put it off after everything else, which only makes me feel more exhausted in the end.
I've included my most recent draft. I commented pretty extensively, because I've found that breaking the code up so much keeps me from getting overwhelmed or confused.
