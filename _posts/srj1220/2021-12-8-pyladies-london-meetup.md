*Pyladies London Meetup 11/19/2021: Let's contribute to Pandas!

I attended this meetup online through Google Meet. Since it was targeted at people in the UK, the meeting was scehduled from 4-6am CT, but I ended up beng in the meeting from 4 to 9 am. I was very nervous to attend this meeting, but a few of our classmates also attended, which made me feel a lot better, since I wasn't the only beginner (or American) there.

The meeting started right on time, and started with a rundown of what Pandas is and what we would be doing. It was plainly stated that even beginners could participate, and that there would be assistance if we needed it. I did end up needing quite a bit of it, to be fair. A checklist was shared to help everyone keep on track and so that it was easier to know if and where a participant got stuck along the way.
Even without my fellow classmates joining in, there were a few participants that I noticed who were from different time zones and skill levels. I had originally had fears of being questioned as to why I was there, since I didn't live anywhere nearby. I was quite nervous to participate in the beginning, but ended up speaking quite a bit due to the help I needed troubleshooting.

I was one of the only people using a Windows computer, which was both mildly surprising and also caused me to have a lot of problems finding solutions to issues that I was having. I ended up being separated out into a breakout room with another Windows user and another participant who was also needing extra assistance, which was extremely helpful. I ended up spending all but about 30 minutes of the 5 hours in that breakout room getting one-on-one help.
I needed assistance knowing exactly what to download, how to get it to run, etc. and hit a snag getting the download to work which, in the end, we couldn't find a solution to. Thankfully, any nervousness that I had about discussing my abilities and problems went away fairly quickly, since we spent so much time trying to solve the problems we were having. The leader who was assisting us, Richard, the fellow Windows user, and myself did spend a lot of time discussing and testing different things to get us back on track, which certainly felt beneficial, though I'm not certain I could replicate what we did now, at all.
From what I remember, we had trouble getting our cloned forks to "work", so us Windows users couldn't get to the step that involved creating a branch to create our changes in. Richard did mention that we were helpful in regards to letting him know to inform others that more work needs to be done to write up instructions for Windows users and/or have a Windows-using meetup leader present for troubleshooting the next time Pyladies London hold a Pandas event.

I believe that I would find this sort of meetup helpful in the future, though I would want to double check that I can get assistance for Windows if it comes to it. I could find a mac to use, but I am generally more confident on Windows so there is a trade-off there for sure.
As far as a learning experience goes, I think that attending this meetup was good because, like I said, I was able to talk about command prompts and how contributing to open-source projects like Pandas works with Richard and the other participants in the breakout room. I also feel like I would be a lot less nervous to enter another meeting of this type, because I've already had a "disaster", in that we couldn't get anything to work. If I can get things to work at all next time, I'll be doing great!
I could see myself joining in a group of this type in the future, especially since Pyladies London change topics for nearly every meeting. The meeting after the Pandas meeting was an analytical presentation about women's representation in various pariaments worldwide. Even if I don't have interest in or don't have the skill level required to participate in one meeting, I would likely be able to participate in others with no issues!
