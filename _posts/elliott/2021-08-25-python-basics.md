INF 380P. The P is for Party.

# Quick Intro

tl;dl: Coding should be fun!  Do lots of it and you'll get good at it.  Don't cheat, pay attention, be on time.

* My bio
* My stance on Honor
* My pay attention policy
* My late policy
* The benefits and challenges of our Hybrid Covid style course
* Questions for me?
* Some questions for you are in the welcome form you'll fill out today
* Basic orientation to website

Read the syllabus and feel free to [email me](mailto:eah13@utexas.edu) with any questions or concerns.

# Why this class is cool:

* You will make games and command line scripts with Python
* You will submit and merge pull requests on github (an important professional skill!)
* You will use several languages besides Python including YAML, Markdown, and HTML
* You will feel confident and be effective a learning new things
* You will learn problem solving strategies and attitudes that will serve you well in any career

# Why Python is Cool

But programs can also be very simple, and we'll start simple.

# Your First Python Program

Programs are composed of small pieces.  In this class you'll learn about the pieces and then put the pieces together to form more and more complex programs.  Our first in-class
exercise will take you from drawing a simple line to making more complex drawings.  This will prepare you for your first homework, which is to use what we learn in class
and online resources to make a drawing.

You, yes you, right now, can edit this program! Find and change the color names and click run:

We'll talk a bit more about the interface of trinket in class.

# Overview of the Materials Page

I want to explain the [materials]({{ site.baseurl }}/materials.html) page, and highlight a few things.

* The materials page is the best overview of what's going to happen in class. I'll explain a little later about the different platforms we're going to use, but you should bookmark the class website, check it every week, and use it to link to the other platforms we'll use.
* Readings will be due by the beginning of class. We're using an interactive textbook edited by University of Michigan School of Information professor Barbara Ericson, who is an expert in coding education. It's really quite excellent. The platform we're using to access it, Runestone, is powerful but has some rough edges. It will be worth it, trust me.
* When you read the textbook, there will be a lot of little activities and quizzes. **Do the activities**. Not only will that let me see you've engaged with the readings, it is a key part of your learning.
* Especially in the first few sessions, we'll complete exercises related to the readings together during class. When we're in person, those will be individual activities which we'll discuss as a class. When we're remote, I'll incorporate group and/or pair programming components to some of the questions.
* All in-class exercises should be completeable during class. If you're able to do this, your homework will mostly be reading and interacting with the textbook. You'll have until midnight each day of class if you need extra time in the evenings.
* **Always** access your textbook and exercises via the links in Canvas. This will ensure (well, make it more likely) that your work and grades get synced back to Canvas. Don't worry: problems with this syncing won't affect your grade, but this is a big class so it'll be easier for everyone if the systems talk to each other correctly.
* We'll talk about some larger projects and the final when it gets closer to time for them.
* **Reflections** are a big part of this class. I'm still revising exactly how you'll turn them in, but it will likely be in Canvas to start. More next week since your first reflection is due in two weeks on the 8th.

Complete these by the beginning of next class:

* Read about Variables
* Read about Debugging
* Read Why Python

Finally, let's review via an [Overview of the Platforms We'll Use]({{site.baseurl}}/how-to/exercise/platforms.html). This and other content you might want to reference later is in the class website's How-to tab.

# Intermission

Let's take a break.

# Class Part 2: Why Program?

I want to get everyone familiar with our textbook platform, and accessing it through canvas. This will be one of the only times we read in class.

* Go to [**Canvas**]({{ site.canvas_url}}) and click on Pre-reading. Read through the chapter and complete the activities on each page.

Once everyone has made it through most of the chapter, we'll turn to the exercises together.

If you finish early:

* Submit your welcome form

# Intermission

Second break

# Attendance and a bit about you

Let's briefly get to know each other's names and backgrounds! Please answer the following when I call on you:

* Your name
* What are you studying?
* Why are you interested in programming?
* What's your favorite piece of software ever? Could be a website, mobile app, a historical program like ELIZA, or the classic DOC game Oregon Trail.

**Note: With reasonable exceptions, we'll ask everyone to sit in the same place all semester to aid in contact tracing in the unfortunate event that anyone in class gets Covid this semester**

# Last Words / Next Steps


* A theme for programming: **type and read your code closely**
* We're aiming for *cutural immersion*, not *cultural assimilation*. Be open to coding cultures, and be yourself within them!

If you haven't submitted your welcome form, please do so before Midnight!
