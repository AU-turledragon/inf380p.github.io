# Welcome to our new Teaching Assistant Misha Coleman

Misha has several years of professional programming experience, and has seen the benefits of a supportive technical community firsthand. We're lucky to have her!

# Feedback Form

Some quotes:

# September 30th we will be Remote

You're *welcome* to come use the classroom

# Recommended Reading

With many concepts, our text doesn't explain as much as [Automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter3/) does; check that
link for more info on **return values**, **scope**, and any other concepts that don't click for you.

# Questions & Answers

* What's the deal with `i` in `for i in range(4)`?
* What are *hashes*? What's a SHA-1 hash?
* Anything else?

In general: I make mistakes and forget things! It's always OK to remind me or ask questions.

# Peer Code Review

This is where those of you who have been commenting, reflecting, and pull request titling will
win friends because of it.  And if the purpose for and audience of these hasn't quite sunk in yet, reading
other people's code is the best way for it to.

# Part I - ~30m
Pair up via Zoom breakouts

* *Request a Review* from your partner
* *Assign* your partner's pull request to yourself in response to their request for review
* *Review* your partner's PR (using *Request Changes* if needed)
* *Merge* your partner's PR once it looks ready
* View their live post on the site
* *If you or your partner's post doesn't display*, work together to diagnose what is wrong about it: the filename, folders, YAML header, etc. If you can't figure this out, *Ask for Help* via zoom and we'll drop in.
* Take a break when you're done. Misha and I will pop in to help and stragglers.


Reconvene at the agreed time for Part II.

# Part II

On your own (~30m) :
* Fill out the [Turtle Peer Review](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfvBOTEVgWOxTv0lOgl513beHZksdebOlQSH7m6th43JzEQkQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) form.
* Submit the form. Your partner will get a copy of your feedback after I review it.
* Take a break when you're done.

Back in new breakout groups at the agreed time: (~30m)
* Show off the partner you reviewed's code to the group
* Discuss the differnces between programs with your new partner(s)
* What did you you learn from reviewing others' code?

# Part III
All together at the agreed time:
* Show off a partner's work in front of class (~30m)


# Looking Ahead

Major projects coming up soon!

* Clicky turtlehack: Due Oct 7th
* Reflection on the class so far: Due Oct 7th
* Blackjack text game or Turtle Drawing App: Due Oct 28th
* Final Project due Dec 11th

The latter two will have intermediate assignments which will help you scope them out.

# Next Time

Lots of work for next week!  Pace yourself.  Start early.  We've got to keep going so we don't fall behind.

* Chapter 5 reading & exercises.  We'll *finally* go over loops!  Woot.
* Chapter 6 reading & exercises.  **Strings** aka text.  Super fun.
* Chapter 8 reading & exercises.  Lists.  Super useful!
* Recommended: Automate the Boring Stuff Lists and loops.

Why cram all these together?  Well, they're related.  Loops are loops **over** a list.  The familiar `range(4)` produces a list.  `for i in range(4)` produces the list `[0,1,2,3]`, assign each of them to `i` and completes the code in the for block.

Strings are just lists of characters, with additional methods (like `.format()` and `.contains()`) built in for our convenience.

So, it's a lot of material, but doing it all at once should help it all sink in.

# Flex time

*If you have posts that aren't showing up on the people page*, we'll walk through some examples of how to fix this.
