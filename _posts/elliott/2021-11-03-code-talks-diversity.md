# Diversity & Inclusion in Programming: Group Discussion

You have a new superpower. Hack for good!

The readings for today

- Silent Tech Privelege
- Python's Diversity Statement
- We're not Done Yet

Circle up & let's chat a bit.

I want to talk about _your_ experiences of inclusiveness, or lack thereof, in technical communities. 'Community' can mean in person, online, or even written output, such as blogs. While there are undoubtedly malicious people in some technical communities, sometimes, the vast majority of non-inclusive spaces come from ignorance and/or apathy preventing people from taking inclusive action. Inclusive action takes knowledge, thought, and effort, and the spaces that put in this work are hugely different than those that don't.

Some questions to seed our discussion:

* Have you felt welcome in technical spaces? If so, what contributed to this? What actions resulted in that?
* If not, what _lack of actions or knowledge_ contributed to this?
* What inclusive actions have you seen from yourself or your classmates in this space?
* Are there ways you can address apathy and/or ignorance in yourself or others?
* How might you take inclusive action outside this technical community?

Some ground rules:

- Use "I" statements. Focus on your lived experience best you can, instead of speculating about others'.
- Respect others' "I" statements, and avoid defensiveness or assigning blame.
- Listen actively, and seek understanding.
- Think of these rules as inclusive actions that we're taking together to make our classroom community welcoming and open.


**Note: Class is remote, not in person. Our classroom remains available for any student who wants to use it to attend remote class.**

# Q&A

* Who's attended a meetup yet?
* Everyone's doing fine. Most of you are doing really well! What do you want to get out of the rest of the class? Use your projects to do that.
* Midterm cancelled (unless there is a general outcry). I want you to focus on final project ideas.

# Code Talks

Pair up & merge up.

First up: Turtle

Next up: Blackjack

Some topics to consider during your 3-4 minute code talk:

- History and organization of your code
- Features of your program
- How your process (e.g. milestones) changed
- What would you do if you were to **keep going** on this program?

# Classes

Classes are recipes for making objects.  They allow you to use familiar notation to define methods, similar to functions, and attributes, similar to variables.

Here's an example:

You can also base classes on preexisting ones.  This is called **class extension**.  Here's an example of how to make a `BoxTurtle` class, which is a turtle but different in key ways we specify.

Next week, I'll ask you to use this new knowledge to improve an existing trinket, both by refactoring it and by adding some new feature using the abilities of classes.

Volunteer for an example?
