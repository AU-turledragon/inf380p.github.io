**Note: Class is remote, not in person. Our classroom remains available for any student who wants to use it to attend remote class.**

# Q&A

* Who's attended a meetup yet?
* Everyone's doing fine. Most of you are doing really well! What do you want to get out of the rest of the class? Use your projects to do that.
* Midterm cancelled (unless there is a general outcry). I want you to focus on final project ideas.

# Code Talks

Pair up & merge up.

First up: Turtle

Next up: Blackjack

Some topics to consider during your 3-4 minute code talk:

- History and organization of your code
- Features of your program
- How your process (e.g. milestones) changed
- What would you do if you were to **keep going** on this program?


# Diversity & Inclusion in Programming: Group Discussion

You have a new superpower. Hack for good!

The readings for today

- Silent Tech Privelege
- Python's Diversity Statement
- We're not Done Yet

Circle up & let's chat a bit.

# Classes

Classes are recipes for making objects.  They allow you to use familiar notation to define methods, similar to functions, and attributes, similar to variables.

Here's an example:

You can also base classes on preexisting ones.  This is called **class extension**.  Here's an example of how to make a `BoxTurtle` class, which is a turtle but different in key ways we specify.

Next week, I'll ask you to use this new knowledge to improve an existing trinket, both by refactoring it and by adding some new feature using the abilities of classes.

Volunteer for an example?
