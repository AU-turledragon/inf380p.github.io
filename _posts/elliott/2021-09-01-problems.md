no, seriously. Don't panic.

Runestone Policy: Just Learn
* Exercises are a huge part of your grade, but we're not trying to nickel and dime you. Everyone will be able to get full credit for the exercises if you put in full effort. That's part of why we're doing them together in class: you'll be able to stuggle, have questions, and get answers.
* Relatedly, we're getting the kinks ironed out of the Runeston connection. Most of it was our fault, clicking Autograde too early. Almost everyone's scores got imported into Canvas (yay!). The first reading and assignment **don't** count towards your final grade, so all we're checking is whether everything transferred over correctly.
* We'll always give you the benefit of the doubt. **Just Learn** and everything will be OK. Promise.

Runestone Tips:
* Get to all of your assignments via the link on Canvas. There's something magical (i.e. a poor UI choice) about doing that that helps your grade get back into Canvas.
* Use the "Mark as Completed" button at the bottom of readings when you complete each section
* You'll see buttons to mark work "Started" and "Complete" as long as Misha or I hasn't used the autograde feature yet. Use them.
* The "Score Me" button seems to remove the work you've done on manually graded problems from **your** view. We can still see it as submitted. So, you haven't lost work, but it looks like you have, and it's hard to know whether you've done everything. We recommend not using this button until/unless we understand it better.
* The messaging around whether you can re-submit work etc. appears to be misleading, but we think this will be better now that we know not to grade til the end.

Important update: my **office hours** are posted on [the syllabus]({{ site.baseurl}}/syllabus.html). Schedule 15 minutes on Zoom with me, usually on Fridays 12-2. I'll add more times as needed or if I have a conflict.

We're also going to start using some remote tools this week in preparation for **remote class next week*.

# Repetition is Good For You

Today: we will **repeat** a lot of things. That's both because we have some new classmates and because during repetition you'll see more **layers** start to unfold for you.

Some initial concepts to repeat:

* Think about where you fall on the "tell me what to do" and "tell me how it works" spectrum. You'll need both kinds of learning in this class. Start to notice when each type is helpful to you.
* In addition to learning style, pay attention to things that confuse or block you, and "light bulbs" that turn on for you. These are key learning moments and will help you take charge of your path.
* Our textbook has given you four initial problem solving strategies to draw from: **Read, Run, Ruminate, Retreat**. Each of these will be useful to you in different situations. You might feel yourself drawn to one in particular. Try them all out, especially if you find yourself getting stuck on a tough problem.

# Glossary Extravaganza

We ain't afraid of no words.  What words have you encountered in or out of class that you don't know the precise meaning to?  We'll write them up on the board and I'll work explanations into the class.

# Initial Q&A

* What Questions do you have?


OK, let's talk about some code.



# Chapter 2: Variables

## Content Highlights

How'd you find the textbook?

Let's discuss each of these briefly:

* Variable names and keywords
* Statements: executeable units
* Operators: Ways of combining/computing things
* Expressions: values and/or variables, by themselves or with operators
* Modulus: the 'remainder'
* 'Good' variable names: Our first encounter with "Goodness" in code

Any other questions from the reading?


## Exercises

Take a break, work on this individually, and we'll talk as a group.




# Debugging: Solving Problems

First off: *Errors are Python's, not (always) yours*. Don't feel bad about yourself when you get an error. Try to understand what Python is telling you. Like a little baby, it only has a few ways to communicate with you. But if you get good at understanding them you'll be able to 1) interpret them when they happen and 2) avoid many of them in the future. But all parents must hear babies cry, and all programmers must deal with errors.

What are the main error types you'll encounter? How do they relate to how Python gets executed?

**Parse Errors** like SyntaxError: This is the parser not understanding how to translate your words into action

**Runtime Errors** like NameError and TypeError are the interpreter not understanding how to do the action you've specififed.

Python is interpreted, so it first parses your code into actions, then starts trying to do them by running them.

## Problem Solving Attitudes

* Self-awareness
* Calm
* Determination

Always know how you feel.  This is critical.  If you know you're frustrated, that could
be a key indicator that it's time to go take a shower (or get a cup of tea, or do some yoga or...).

Keep in mind that you *will* understand the problem.  Work backwards from that certainty.

Don't let uncertainty overwhelm you or lessen your determination.  Focus on the certainty you do have.

Talk it out.

If you're **crushing it** :muscle:, think about other ways the problem could be solved.  If you're not breaking a sweat - if you're not initially confused about something - you're not getting stronger.

## Problem Solving Strategies

**Go in the Right Direction**

* Make sure you know what problem you're trying to solve.  Articulate it clearly.  This is harder than it sounds.
* Make sure you know what you think you know.  Test what you think you know to confirm it. Build from there.
* Keep your **goals** in mind. Sometimes you'll discover you're off on a tangent. Re-focus.

**Work smart**
* Start early.
* Make lists of what you need to accomplish.  I use Google Keep.  Separate the planning from the doing to keep your mind clear.
* Break the problem down into solvable pieces. At least one solveable piece will keep you moving forward.  Once you've solved a piece, save/commit your work and take a breather.
* **Time box.**  Work no more than 15-25 minutes at a time on a single problem.
* Stumped? **Stop** and come back later. In the shower is where many a tough programming problem
has been solved.


**Use Your Resources**
* **Who** would know the answer? Find them, in person or via Google.
* Re-read the relevant parts in our textbook or the other resources I linked to in our syllabus.
* Know what to google for.  Much of the help on the internet (e.g. StackOverflow) is too specific for the
basics. Use a trusted reference when you can, be that a person or a book.

**Problem Solving Tactics For Python**

* `print` what you think things should be and see if they are
* see if you can predict what kind of `Error`s you'll generate
* `try` and `except` errors you don't care about for now
* Comment out as much code as you can to isolate the problem


# Next Week

* First Reflection: details to follow
* Two Chapters. Start early!
* First Remote Class.
