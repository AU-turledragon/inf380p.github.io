# Q&A

- Phew!  After today, we're done with non-final related exercises!

# Part I: Diversity & Inclusion in Programming: Group Discussion

You have a new superpower. Hack for good!

The readings for today

- Silent Tech Privelege
- Python's Diversity Statement
- We're not Done Yet

Circle up & let's chat a bit.

I want to talk about _your_ experiences of inclusiveness, or lack thereof, in technical communities. 'Community' can mean in person, online, or even written output, such as blogs. While there are undoubtedly malicious people in some technical communities, sometimes, the vast majority of non-inclusive spaces come from ignorance and/or apathy preventing people from taking inclusive action. Inclusive action takes knowledge, thought, and effort, and the spaces that put in this work are hugely different than those that don't.

Some questions to seed our discussion:

* Have you felt welcome in technical spaces? If so, what contributed to this? What actions resulted in that?
* If not, what _lack of actions or knowledge_ contributed to this?
* What inclusive actions have you seen from yourself or your classmates in this space?
* Are there ways you can address apathy and/or ignorance in yourself or others?
* How might you take inclusive action outside this technical community?

Some ground rules:

- Use "I" statements. Focus on your lived experience best you can, instead of speculating about others'.
- Respect others' "I" statements, and avoid defensiveness or assigning blame.
- Listen actively, and seek understanding.
- Think of these rules as inclusive actions that we're taking together to make our classroom community welcoming and open.

# Part II: Project Planning & Discussion

# Analysts

Check this example code for the kind of text-based interface I'm looking for:

You can use functions to respond to the options, or you could store the choice in a variable that's
passed to one function that changes its behavior based on logic you write.

You'll need to get your dataset inside the function, either as a parameter or as a global.

# Turtlers

Remember my video?  There's a chapter on using dictionaries in Turtle!

There's also an example game with levels.

# Permanent Groups

Time to make our final pairs & groups.

* Pair up
* Merge Final Idea
* **Group Up** and discuss with your group

Go around, state your proposed project, and work with the group to critique and strengthen it.  Ask questions of each other!  Take notes on how you'd revise your plan in light of the feedback you've gotten.  At the end of class or tonight, Revise your plan as described in assignments.

# Classhack: In class exercise

Work on this in class, and finish tonight if needed.
