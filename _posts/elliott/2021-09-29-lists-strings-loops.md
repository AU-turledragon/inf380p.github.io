# Escape Velocity

My goal for all of you is to get you into orbit, able to keep learning on your own and
ready for a wide range of new technologies.  Let's recalibrate what success means.

# Part I

Some code examples to start us off
* While True, continue and break

* what `try`/`except` does to your program

* use **list and string operations, methods, and functions** to do the hard work for you. This is why we have data types!

Let's review the *boatload* of homework you did.  Now.

# Part II

We're doing more chapter 8 exercises, but more importantly we're learning
a technique called **pair programming**.  This is both a real technique used
by professional programmers and a learning strategy that's been shown to
improve outcomes.  Double win!

First, a [warmup]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise/gerund-challenge.html). I'll navigate.

# Part III

Next, more exercises.  Complete these in a pair programming style, then have both partners submit the same code. [Let's go!]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise/ch8-more.html)



# Next Time (see materials page for descriptions)

**For extra credit**, submit your work as a coauthored post.

**Clickyhack turtle.**

Again, another open-ended exercise for your to make something unique.  You've got **Lots** more tools now, but you may not know how to put them to use.  Combine your ideas with the things we've learned to make a program that uses all of the language features we've covered so far, starting from a helpful template I made for you.

**Reflection on the Class So Far**

Far and away, the students who reflect the best, perform the best.  This is your opportunity to either continue your reflection excellence or bring it up to speed.  Use terms from class like problem solving strategies, attitudes, challenges, and lightbulbs to describe your journey so far.  Help me (and yourself!) understand your path.
