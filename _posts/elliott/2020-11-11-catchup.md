# Project Update

You know the drill.  This time, **use your snapshots**.

* Pair up
* Merge up
* Stand up (not literally)

During standup:

* What did you say you'd do?
* What did you actually do?
* Show and tell your program
* What will you do for next class?
* Any problems?

After everyone's done their update, we'll reconvene to discuss.


Then, on your own, revise your milestones (in your existing post) and **atmention your partner to merge your revisions**.

You should finish class with revised milestones merged.

Use any remaining time to work on your project!
