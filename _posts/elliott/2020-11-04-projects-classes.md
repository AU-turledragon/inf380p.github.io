# Q&A

- Phew!  After today, we're done with non-final related exercises!



# Analysts

Check this example code for the kind of text-based interface I'm looking for:

You can use functions to respond to the options, or you could store the choice in a variable that's
passed to one function that changes its behavior based on logic you write.

You'll need to get your dataset inside the function, either as a parameter or as a global.

# Turtlers

Remember my video?  There's a chapter on using dictionaries in Turtle!

There's also an example game with levels.

# Permanent Groups

Time to make our final pairs & groups.

* Pair up
* Merge Final Idea
* **Group Up** and discuss with your group

Go around, state your proposed project, and work with the group to critique and strengthen it.  Ask questions of each other!  Take notes on how you'd revise your plan in light of the feedback you've gotten.  At the end of class or tonight, Revise your plan as described in assignments.

# Classhack: In class exercise

Work on this in class, and finish tonight if needed.
