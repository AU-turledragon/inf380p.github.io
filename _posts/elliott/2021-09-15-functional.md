# Today: ZOOM

* Everyone please *mute* your speakers. We have a remote classmate and don't want feedback.
* Please use your *headphones* in breakout rooms today. Zoom compensates for the fact that you can't look over your partner's shoulder in person (thanks, Covid)
* I added a Zoom section to the menu bar with a convenient link to the room we'll use from now on. :crossed_fingers: This should automatically record to the cloud and show up in our Panopto folder. We're learning together...

# Q&A

* Vocab hotseat!  Got some vocab getting you down? Or a concept that's giving you fits? Let's throw it on the board and clear things up.
* When to use variables:

* Variables are power because they store the *results* of an expression. Functions are even more powerful because they store *recipes* of expressions that can be reused and even modified depending on how you *call* them. More on functions later this class, but I wanted to make the connection here. Both of these programming concepts were invented and are taught because they're *useful*. _They did not always exist_. Thank you, past programmers, for inventing useful things for yourselves that happen to also be useful to us.

# Part I: Turtlehacks

Schedule:
* Pair up and Merge up (30m)
* Code talks (30m)

We'll take breaks within these sections as indicated below.

# Pair up and Merge Up

Pair up (via Zoom breakout rooms) and merge up!

Some steps:

* "Request Review" from your partner in the right-hand portion of the pull request's Conversation tab. This is a mechanism to ask a specific person to look at your code on a project. I want you to know it exists, even though you can ask your partner verbally to review your PR.
* Use the how-tos page and/or your notes to confirm that everything looks good for your partner. Approve or Request Changes
* When you're both done, make any needed changes. Use each other as a resource for this!
* Review, approve, and merge your partner's changes, if needed.
* Verify that both your posts show up on our website. If not, try to diagnose why together. Ask for help if needed.

Take a break for any remaining time.

# Code Talks on your Turtlehacks

* Read & discuss each other's programs with your partner.
* New Group up
* Circle up

Take a break for any Remaining time.

# Part II: Functions

Schedule:

* My comments about Functions - 10m
* Your questions - 10-20m
* Homework code talks - 15-30m
* Break - 10m

# Functions as Idioms

Generally, pull your function **definitions** up out of the code, then **call** them
in your code.

Conditionally defining a function (probably a bad idea):

# Backing up: Anatomy of a function

I never really got **parameter** vs **argument** until late in my career.  Now you know :)

# Part III: Functional Turtle Trinket & Pull Request

Schedule:
* Work on functional turtle assignment - 15m
* Pair up and discuss - 15m
* Wrap-up comments, Looking ahead, and Survey - 5-10m

Balance of time: Complete in-class or homework assignments

# Functional Turles: In Class

Link in assignments.

# Looking ahead

* My Treasure hunt game, demonstrating click events and with an instructions animation:

Clicky Turtles are on their way!  You'll need Chapter 2 of my video to learn about them (they're not in the textbook)


# Homework: Treasure Hunt Turtles

Check it out on the assignments page.  **Use your resources**

# Please complete this survey!

This will help inform the rest of the semester:

Mark "N/A" of leave blank if questions don't apply to you or you don't have any feedback for me on that question.
