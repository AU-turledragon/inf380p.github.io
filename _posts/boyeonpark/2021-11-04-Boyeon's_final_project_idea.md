I chose a data analysis project since I am interested in data science, 
I am taking this course to learn basic skills of Python so that I can expand it to machine learning, AI, etc in the future. 
So I thought it would be a great chance to start disciplining my data analyzing ability here. 

I have known an open community ‘Kaggle’ 
(I just signed up and was about to explore during winter vacation preparing for a machine learning class I will be taking for the next semester)
which has numerous data sets for coding so I looked for one there and picked the population data sets because I thought it is good to make functions with it. 
* data source: https://www.kaggle.com/cityapiio/countries-population-2010-2020-data

First step to do 
- make file as txt file to import on Trinket
- start with basic things, file reading, storing into dictionary

I will be providing features like
- max/min population country by year
- rank by year
- avg population by year
- avg population by country
- change percentage comparing to previous year by country 

This is what I have done so far (just started..)
