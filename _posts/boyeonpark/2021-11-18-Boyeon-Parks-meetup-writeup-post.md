I attended a meetup, ‘Intro To Data Science: Linear Regression Models Workshop ‘ by NYC Learning Community 
| Flatiron School group on meetup website. This meetup was held on 18 Nov. 

•	How did it go?

It was kind of big meetup which more than 700 people joined all from different states and even different countries.
The meetup was held as a webinar through zoom, people chatted a lot together, so it seemed very active.  

The host provided github url which contained all the lecture notes so it was easy to catch up and see the python code of examples.
And the nice thing about meet up was there were active Q&As so it went very interactively.

•	What did you learn?

The topic was General introduction of Linear Regression, how to use linear regression in python, 
how to interpret the model and determine how well it performs. 
Although it was the first time to get to know linear regression in Python, the content was basic level so I could catch up quite well. 

I found that numpy and pandas are very easy to use when analyzing data through the example codes. 
And using them, building a basic linear regression model wasn’t that difficult in Python. 
Although we didn't cover those in class, I would be practicing more about them later and I think I would be able to apply them to codes later. 
And the linear regression examples of Python were easier than I expected and I found fun building a basic model of linear regression using python in this meetup
so I would be practicing with more data later. 

•	Would you find value in this kind of event after class?

Yes, it was more interesting than I expected. Not only content but also seeing people enthusiastic about learning coding were such great chance to see and motivate myself to learn more.
And it was great to see people using Github to communicate in the real world. I was so glad that I have a little knowledge of Github that I learned through this class so far.
 

•	How was the experience different from your expectations?

Actually, one meetup that I was going to attend was once canceled(more like no-show of the host) so I was very disappointed and skeptical about meet up things
and I found this meetup for the back up plan. And this went so well, better than I expected. 
I was glad that it went well so that I can have more interest about attending this kind of meetup for later.

•	Could you see yourself becomming a member of a professional community like this in the future?

The canceled one was really small group meetup (10~30 attendees) and this one was really big group (700+) so I would be looking for some meet ups of big groups like this in the future as well.
I kind of liked this so I will look for other good meet ups which I can easily catch up with, but it seems my knowledge is very little now 
so I would be focusing on learning basic skills more and then will be participating in meet ups more actively.
