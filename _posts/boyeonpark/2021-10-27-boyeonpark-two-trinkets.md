# Reflection

This chapter was the most interesting chapter I ever had in this class.
I prepared my own code which draws a triangle or a square using a function, for loop and chained conditionals. 
And I wondered what shapes there are including a turtle and searched about it on google and then I added some code below to see what shapes there are. 

It was interesting to see how intuitive the function names are in Python. Especially, `pendown()` and `penup()` are ones we can just imagine what they do from their names. 

I wonder how Turtle can be used furtherly in the real word.
