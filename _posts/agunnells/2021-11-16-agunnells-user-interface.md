# Project Progress

My original plan was to do a data analysis project that would allow the user to compare word counts and frequency of a word's occurrence across a series of short stories. My general project plan has remained the same, with some modifications. The primary modification has been the stories that I am using. I originally planned to use three short stories written by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Instead, I am comparing three short stories written by three different authors: Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Virginia Woolf, and Kate Chopin. The remaining aspects of my original project plan remain in place.

So far, I have completed two of the project milestones that I set for myself:
1. Identify texts to use in the project; write code to open and read the text file, as well as remove all punctuation marks
2. Create a dictionary for each text file; write a function that uses a `for` loop to count each instance of each word in the text file and add each new instance to the text file's corresponding dictionary

I still have to complete the following milestones:
3. Create a custom module that provides a variety of actions for the user to perform on a text file's dictionary
4. Incorporate `pygal` so that the user can produce visuals from the data
5. Create help text and determine how the user will access it

# Reflection

Right now, I feel like I have attained a good balance with how ambitious this project is. There are some stretch goals, but overall I think the project can reasonably be completed based on the time I have and my skill level. I think I may encounter some roadblocks with writing code for the actual data analysis, as well as figuring out how to use `pygal` for the visualizations. Although I do believe that I can write code that allows the user to analyze the data, I anticipate it taking the most time out of any component of the project. I want to make sure that I am providing a decent amount of options for the user, such as word counts of a text, counts of individual words, frequency of a word's appearance, and comparisons of words across texts. In addition, I anticipate needing some time to work with `pygal` simply because I have not used it before. Ultimately, though, I am confident that I can complete this project by the deadline. 

# My Plan for Next Class

For next class, I plan to have at least the basic code for my data analysis written. At minimum, I want to have code that can provide a word count of a whole text, as well as code that will prompt the user to enter a word, and then count how many times that word appears in a text. If I am able to do those tasks easily, I might add on some extra components, such as representing a word's frequency in a text.
