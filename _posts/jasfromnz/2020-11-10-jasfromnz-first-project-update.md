Here's my project so far:

I haven't been able to spend a lot of time on my project this week because I was really ill, but I'm happy with what I was able to accomplish in spite of that. I don't have a very solid idea of what my code will look like in the later steps of my project, so it's hard to anticipate roadblocks right now. Instead, I'm just taking it one small step at a time. I've already added some steps to my plan, because now that I've started the project, it's easier to see *how* I want to do things. For example, I've already found a way to work classes into my project, when I wasn't sure how I would use them before. I anticipate the hardest part of the project will be the next step, which is creating the operation functions, and how ambitious my project is will depend on how which operations I include.

Original Milestones:
* Opens files and puts lines into a dictionary
* Set up functions for operations
* Create function to print results
* Create help text function
* Make iterative
* Allow user to exit program
* Account for data type errors

Updated Milestones:
- [x] Opens files and puts lines into a dictionary
- [x] Create a class the countries in data
- [ ] Define column data type
- [ ] Set up functions for operations:
  * print column
  * min/max/avg
  * compare two columns (min/max/avg difference)
  * range (first/last) items in column
- [ ] Create function to print results
- [ ] Create help text function
- [ ] Create option menu
- [ ] Make iterative
- [ ] Allow user to exit program
- [ ] Account for data type errors
- [ ] Modify functions to display data for each country
- [ ] Create option to pick one or more countries to compare
- [ ] Automate column data type detection
