For the Functional Turtle exercise, I refactored my Logical Turtle exercise. Here's the remixed code:

This exercise felt fairly easy. I started off remixing my Custom Turtle project, but it was such a simple program that it only took a few minutes, so I decided to try to remix my Logical Turtle project instead. My Logical Turtle code already had only two main components, both of which were easily made into functions. The hardest part of this was just reading my old code to figure out what needed to be moved or changed. In the end, it wasn't much harder to refactor my Logical Turtle project than the Custom Turtle, but I appreciated the practice in reading code, and the end result was definitely a much cleaner and more legible code than the original project.
