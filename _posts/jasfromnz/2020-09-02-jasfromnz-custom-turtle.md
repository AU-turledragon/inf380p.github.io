Here's my custom turtle:

Today's exercises where a little frustrating. I forgot some of the syntax used in turtle for changing tina and the background's color and had to go back to our class notes to find it. When I have tried to learn coding in the past, remembering syntax was always by biggest struggle and was what ulitmately made me lose interest. I'm hoping that as I start to gain a better understanding of why things look the way they do in Python, that will help me to commit proper syntax to memory. In the meantime though, I have to do a lot of referencing back to my notes, which gets frustrating quickly. I also had an issue when I went to add the embed code to my custom turtle post on the github page, but I couldn't find it anywhere. The hard part of that was not having to start over, but that I'm not sure what happened and how to avoid it in the future. Overall, today felt much harder and I feel less confident in my ability to do well going forward, but I'm trying to remain positive and hope that with experience, these types of issues will become less of a problem.
