Here's my turtlehack:

I'm *really* proud of this project! When I got the idea for it, I wasn't sure that I would be able to get it to work. It took a lot of trial and error, and a little bit of googling, but in the end it wasn't nearly as hard as I thought it would be. I learned about time.sleep() which is really useful, and I finally figured out why I could never get my if statements to compare strings (it was a syntax issue). I also got to try out the random.choice() function and see how it works. Overall, I'm very happy with how this turned out, and I both learned new things and improved old skills while doing it.
