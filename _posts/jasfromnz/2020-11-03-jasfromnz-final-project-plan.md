For my final project, I want to do data analysis. According to the final project criteria on the class website, it needs to be a generic tool that can take any file, rather than building it for a specific type of data files. So for my project, I plan to build a data analysis tool that takes CSV files and allows a user to pick columns to run operations and print out tables of information. Some of the operations I want to include are finding the mean, min and max of a column, finding the difference between two columns, and alphabetizing columns. Iâ€™m not sure what else I can do within the bounds of the assignment, since the tool needs to take any file.

Milestones:
[]Opens files and puts lines into a dictionary
[]Set up functions for operations
[]Create function to print results
[]Create help text function
[]Make iterative
[]Allow user to exit program
[]Account for data type errors
