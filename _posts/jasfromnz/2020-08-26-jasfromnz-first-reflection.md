I really enjoyed using turtle in trinket.io today. Figuring out what some of the code elements did on my own made it feel a lot more exciting. Although trying to get things like the angles and spacing in my own picture right was frustrating at times, seeing the end result that I created have me more confidence in my ability to understand coding. I don't feel comfortable with using and posting on github yet because I don't understand what a lot of the language means (like a pull request) but I'm hoping that will be explained in the course soon.
