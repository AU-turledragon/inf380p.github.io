Here's my logical turtle project:

I got stuck on a few different errors today. I forgot the colon at the end of my if statements, and could not figure it out until in the breakout groups when a classmate pointed out my error. After that, I could not figure out how to make Python match an input string with an identical string. For example, if a user input "A", Python would run the code for when input = "A", but it would also run input = "B" and "C" as true as well. In the end I fixed this by changing the input format to numbers, but I would love to figure out a work around for this error in the future. Overall, I'm happy with how my code turned out considering how quickly  I put it together, and the only code I copied and pasted was for drawing the shapes.
