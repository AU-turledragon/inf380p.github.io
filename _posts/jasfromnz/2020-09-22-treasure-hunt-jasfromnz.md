Here's my Turtle Treasure Hunt game:

I felt really unsure of how to start with this assignment, but the breakdown of steps in the comments really helped. Once I wrote the first few lines of code, it started to come a lot more easily, and I finished the main part of my code pretty quickly. After I finished, I realized I forgot to account for bad user input, and then I got stuck on that for a while. I wasn't sure what method would be best, or where to put it in my code. I spent close to 30 minutes trying different combinations of "if" statements and "try and except", and in the end I got something that works, but I still feel like there must have been a simplier way to accomplish the same thing.
