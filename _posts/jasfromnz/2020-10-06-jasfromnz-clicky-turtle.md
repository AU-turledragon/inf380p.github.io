Here’s my Clicky Turtle project:

For this assignment, I decided to build off of my Turtle Hack project. When I made my Turtle Hack originally I had tried to make it click based, but at the time I didn’t understand it well enough to make it function so I had to use typed input. This time, I had no trouble getting the “clicky” function to work, and I was able to use helper functions to reduce or eliminate a lot of redundancy in my code. I also spent some time improving the drawings and animations. Despite building off of a previous project, I don’t feel like I avoided practicing any coding skills or did any less work than I would have if I had started from scratch. Overall, I’m really proud of how it turned out.
