I got stuck on my project this week, trying to find a way to make dynamically named class objects. I've tried a lot of different approaches but none of them work the way I think they will. I'm struggling to think of a good way to work around this problem, but I don't know how to and I'm incredibly frustrated with the whole project right now. Before I started this project I didn't understand classes at all, so I've had to learn as I go and it's been really hard. Hopefully I will think of a different solution soon and the rest of the project will go much easier.

Here's my project so far:
