Here's my project so far:

I had hit a major roadblock last week, where I was struggling to use classes in my code. However, I finally figured out a solution, and the process has been going much smoother since then. Iâ€™ve added in a few functions so far and would like to add more, but I am worried I will find it hard to get the rest of the requirements done in time, so I will probably work on those first (adding help text, making it iterative, etc.) and then go back and add more functions if I have time. My plan has changed quite a bit, but I think that it is mostly because it was easier to imagine the necessary steps once I had started the project and had a bit more of an idea of the direction I wanted to go- and how reasonable certain functions would be.

Original Milestones:
Opens files and puts lines into a dictionary
Set up functions for operations
Create function to print results
Create help text function
Make iterative
Allow user to exit program
Account for data type errors

Updated Milestones:
- [x] Opens files and puts lines into a dictionary
- [x] Create a class from the countries in data
- [x] Set up functions for operations:
   -get input function, with bad input error
   -print column
   -min/max/range (first/last) items in column
	 -avg (mean, median, mode)
   -count/total (excludes missing data)
- [x] Create option menu
- [x] Create help text function
- [x] Make iterative
- [x] Allow user to exit program

Stretch Goals:
- [ ] Prevent data type errors by column
	-Create function that checks column for data type
	-Make lists of columns by data type
	-Create function that checks if column can be used in a function by checking against list
- [ ] Add functions for comparing across countries
	-compare two columns (min/max/avg difference)
