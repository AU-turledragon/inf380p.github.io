Here are my milestones so far for the Blackjack App.

Basic:
1) User can initiate game
2) Randomly picks 2 cards for user
3) A loop based on user input (Hit or Stay)
4) Function randomly deals a card based on user input
5) Function counts card totals at each step
6) If total is > 21, user loses
7) If user selects Stay, generates dealer score
8) If user score > dealer, user wins

Advanced:
1) Add Jacks, Kings, Queens to card set for deal function
2) Use dealing function to deal cards for computer
3) If computer busts, user wins
