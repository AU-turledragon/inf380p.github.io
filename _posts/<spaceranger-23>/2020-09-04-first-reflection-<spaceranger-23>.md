The first week assignments really challanged my brain on how I think about solving problems. After taking previous python courses online, I assumed that the
first assignment would start with print("Hello, World"). I think it was awesome to write commands to direct turtles to execuate a movement. I did struggle at
first with understanding how to input coordinates to direct a turtle to a certain area, but after a while the system started to make since to me. There is one
thing I know going foward and that is I can think that I will create a complete program in minutes or hours. There is going to be a lot of trail and error that
I will have to make myself work through. Great first assignment and hopefully I am able to execute the first pull request on Github.
