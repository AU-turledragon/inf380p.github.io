It's unclear to me that trinket accepts matplotlib. Sometimes it works, sometimes I have to redo the trinket, as in create a new one with the exact same code and suddenly it works. If it were working properly, I would be on schedule to create my project with a working menu, the pie charts and a data dictionary. I have all the data that I need and I understand the code. What I need is a platform that performs properly.

This is where the latest difficulty is:

```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize =(10, 7))
plt.pie(data, labels = Gender)

```

A javascript error originates regarding figsize.
