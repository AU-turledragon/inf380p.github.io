I don’t know what I’m being asked to reflect on here. There are no instructions about a subject. The instructor keeps talking about light bulbs going off or aha moments which are not occurring, at least for me. Obviously there are people who were already familiar with Github and with Trinket and presumably with turtle. I am concerned, as I have bene throughout that course that, like with turtle, content and homework comes before the lecture. 
The instructor noted last week—I just reviewed the Panopto—that some would question using Github, why we would do this, what does that have to do with coding? It’s not that for me. The timing seems rushed. We are learning Github, which has a lot of bells and whistles, Runestone which continues to have issues, also Trinket as a new platform and now on top of that turtle. Github may be useful in the coding community, I don’t doubt that, but again, the pacing seems dubious. We also have classes to deal with classes. The instructor said earlier in the semester that he doesn’t want us to “spend six or seven hours on this stuff,” but if I review the class video, which I do, that’s three hours alone. These are unrealistic timeframes, unless one already is familiar with the material.
