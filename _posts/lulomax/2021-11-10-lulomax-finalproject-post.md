My plans are still in flux but I'm almost certain that turtles are in my rear-view mirror, thank you very much. On the data front, making graphs I see two possibilities, depending on the available data. One would be a look at diversity, or lack of same, at the iSchool. Specifically this would involved visualizing race and gender for faculty and students. The rubric suggests histograms or bar charts but I think pie charts are better, especially if it's possible to do color fill for races/genders. I have requested some data from the university and it will depend on the response which should be forthcoming. I would have a menu, called Help or a title reflective of what the data shows, I suppose, that will call up the graph and describe what are the outcomes shown. The data set may not be something downloaded from Excel but merely a text file based upon what I get back. For comparison, I think comparisons are always important, I would probably use the Dell Medical School for which I already have some data and which, like the iSchool, is racially-challenged, both in terms of faculty and students. I may include some bulleted points telling the audience what the data shows.

If the iSchool data is not forthcoming, in a timely manner, my second option is some data that I already possess related to the two children's hospitals in Austin, Dell Childrens and St. David's Childrens. I don't know if the data file I have will translate easily, so it might involve some hard-coding of my own. In any case, I would choose one measure on patients, probably respiratory admissions, because respiratory is the single most important diagnosis group for children, and do a few measures, like market share (a pie chart showing who's getting these respiratory patients), severity of cases, which is also tracked, and outcomes, as well as race of patients because race is a major determinant of healthcare outcomes in this country.

Specifically, then, my plan is:
1) Try finding/making a text file with random data to create a pie chart. Or I can use the Dell Med School data I already have. But first, make a pie chart.
2) Conceptualize what the Help menu will show
3) Dictionaries should be easily incorporated by races/genders and values. I'm not sure yet on for loops
4) The code will be interactive to the degree that the user can ask to see one chart or another
