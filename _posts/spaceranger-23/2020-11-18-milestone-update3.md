** Reflection:
For this week update on my project milestone, I was only able to complete the initial steps for web scraping, but still having difficulties pulling certain elements from the website. I was able to install the beautiful-soup dictionary and get the website to pull the entire text from Cyberscoop.com. However, my goal is to extract certain keys words, such as APT 28, United States, Russia, Cyber, and others to identify activity this cyber group is conducting within a two period. I believe after this weekend; I will complete this difficult task and will be able to move on to this visualization point of the data. My updated milestone is going to consist of the following: 

[] Continue to work on beautiful soup extracting different words that pertains to cyber
[] Determine if I can add two websites to conduct the same function as Cyberscoop
[] Outline the steps that I am going to take make the data available for users to visualize. 
[] Refactor the code if possible.
