** Reflection

For this week pull-request, I would like to cover the planning stages of the threat intelligence program. I first begin with laying out the critical components that I need to conduct research on APT 28, which is also known as Fancy Bear and other names. APT 28 is known as a Russian cyber threat group that cause significant damage to critical infrastructure worldwide. To understand APT 28 activities over a two period, I came up with several list for the programs to analyze against open source information. 
Associated Groups: Sofacy, Fancy Bear, Strontium
Intelligence Agency: Russia’s General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)
Military Unit -> 85th Main Special Service Center (GTsSS), unit 26165 and 74455
Keyword of Attacks: Phishing, Malware, DDoS, Distributed Denial-of-Service, Droborub, credential harvesting, espionage, Ukraine, Russia, United States
Next, I found news source to analyze the list against – cyberscoop.com
The next step that I need to conduct in the project is using beautiful soap to pull data out of an HTML link. I currently working through this program to complete this step and will be able to report next time of how things went. 
Objectives Going Forward: 
[] Get beautiful soap to locate keywords within the website Cyberscoop


**Revise Pull Request:
For this pull request, I am going to analyze how to web scrape a website to extract information for data analysis. I need to develop a python script to analyze information in a cybersecurity news source (Cyberscoop). The objective is to pull out key words that I have identified to show that APT 28 has been active in the previous two weeks. 
Goals: 
[] Scrape HTML Content from a Webpage
[] Parse HTML Code with Beautiful Soup
[] Find Elements by HTML Class Name
[] Find Elements By ID
[] Find Elements By Class Name
[] Extract Text From HTML Elements
[] Extract Attributes From HTML Element
