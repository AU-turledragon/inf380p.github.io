## Reflection
The blackjack game took several attempts to complete the assignment. On the first attempt, I drew out on a piece of paper how I would like to set up the game. My instructions were to create a deck cards with values, create players, and develop the while loops to lay all the components in the python program and before grouping the different sections. This first step lead to many errors and confusion within my python game. 

The second step that I took to complete the assignment is finding existing open-source code to modify to fit my game. I thought this step would be easier for me to complete because I would not have to think so hard about the commands/code that I need to draw cards, develop values, and determine the sum. When I took the existing code to modify, I found that I really did not know what the existing code was trying to execute, and this led to another failure with completing the game. 

The third step that I took to complete the game was to print out the instructions that was given by the instructor. I copy and paste each step into Trinket, which made it easier for me to visualize the code that was needed to develop the game. Besides creating each of the cards like I originally intended to, I begin with setting values between 1 and 11 using random.randiant for the system to randomly pick a number. Then I added some additional code to account for both cards that needed to be calculated. 

The next challenging step with the development of the game is figuring out how to update the card when the player choices hit. Furthermore, write a script to end the game if the value was greater than 21. An example that help with the calculation and the end of the program is referring to previous assignments I had with the python programming course. Although I am almost done with completing the basic game, one take away from this assignment is that I need to not make the assignment overly complicated. By breaking down the instructions into bits and pieces, this will help with beginnings of my coding program. In short, The way you start off is the way you finish.
