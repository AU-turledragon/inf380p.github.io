## Reflection 
I made finally made it to completing the Treasure Hunt exercise. It was definitely not easy, but managed to complete this assignment by writing my steps out on a piece of paper. My first issue with completing this assignment is figuring where to place the treasure on the program. I did not know that inserting random.radient script already place the treasure on the map and all I would have to do is get Tina to go to that treasure and report back how close to the treasure. Reporting back and telling the program to say congradulations with tina is near 5 pixels was the next big challange due to not understand the logic behind this step. It took me 4 hours to figure this one step out and could not believe that it made sense after I completed. Python has been difficult to learn but I really enjoy learning because of all the challanges that I experience. This class illustrates the importance of research and for improving your critical thinking skills.
