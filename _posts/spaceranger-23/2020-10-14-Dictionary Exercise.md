# Reflection

I have to say, working with someone else to complete the paired programming dictionary exercise was challenging, but rewarding at the sametime. Despite tackling this assessment individually, two minds are able to present two different courses of actions and thought processes on how to outline/complete this assignment. When Patrick and I first begin the dictionary exercise, we begin by checking the text documents that are interested in Trinket to see if the files were willing to open and be readable. After determining if the files were readable, we type a script using the split so that we can pull the information apart to extract and/or modify the data. 

Secondly, Patrick took control of the program to modify the list from the text file. He simply wrote a script to append the list and and count the number of transitions/total value from all the transactions of the state. What was unique about doing this exercise together is how we were able to complement one another despite I, Reginald having limited Python knowledge and skills. 

Patrick was able to show me some different ways on how to tackle this problem and why certain code in this project is able to run effectively without any errors. Conducting pair programming exercises does really help when it comes to speaking about code and figuring out useful strategies to complete the assignment.
