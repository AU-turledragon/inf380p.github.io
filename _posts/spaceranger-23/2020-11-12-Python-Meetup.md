** Python Meetup:
On Wednesday, November 11, 2020, I attend the Austin Python Monthly Meetup to understand what a community of python developers (beginners, intermediate, or experts) talks about and the projects they are currently working on. First, I will give a brief overview of Rakshak Talwar on "Deploying Computer Vision Models to Edge in the Wild" presentation followed by Nam Nguyen talk on "Giving the Gift of Your Code."
Rakshak was a python developer who currently works for Zenus, a company based in the local Austin area. His presentation covered how he and a group of people develop a machine learning tool to capture people's feelings/emotions, written using Python on a Linux database. This program aims to capture the facial expressions of a large group of people listening to a presentation and, in return, describe their presenter's delivery with their presentations. The results showed that the company presenters could keep their customer's attention in the early mornings and evenings. However, in the afternoons, the attention started to fade by their audience. 
The program did not say the reasons behind the slip in attention. However, the data did give a better understanding of changes that the presenters need to profit from these seminars. In the end, someone did ask if they could see the code; however, Rakshak said no, but ask for investment for additional projects that the company is currently working on. 
Secondly, the next presenter, Nam Nguyen, gave us a high-level overview of how to secure your code within applications. He illustrates that the code needs to be self-contained, easy to build, and understandable by the customers. He attempted to modify some of his previous code within a project to showcase how to implement security within the application using Python. However, there were several issues that the presenter was experiencing during his presentation. 
For example, it took a while for the code to run and switched back to AWS to kill or start an AWS machine, which contributed to losing my interest in the presentation. However, despite the on-going errors, I did learn that a lot of the Python developers use Google Cloud and AWS to support their coding projects. I attempted to ask a question about Python and cloud but ran out of time due to going overbroad. 
 To conclude, this online community was not the right community for me, mainly because I am a beginner in programming. The two presenters were talking about two different types of coding projects, which was way over knowledge. However, I did pick up that many developers are integrating their projects to the cloud and would like to know why this switch. 
The value that I found with participating in the online meet up is the meeting's networking part. Many people who join this community can help with landing jobs in programming in the Austin area or outside of Texas.
Finally, I do foresee myself becoming a member of a professional community like the meetup I attended. Besides being this Python meetup, I would like to choose one in the cybersecurity field and talks about how Python is beneficial to detecting and preventing cyberattacks.
