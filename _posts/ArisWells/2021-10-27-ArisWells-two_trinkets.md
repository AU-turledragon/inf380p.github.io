In contrast with regular expressions or tuples the turtle program seems conceptual simple and relatively narrow in scope/application. Given my current knowledge of python, turtle questions revolved around learning new commands specific to turtle and debugging rather than trying to make sense of loops or data types. In order to complete the questions in Runestone I basically accepted the first two lines
```
from turtle import *
space = Screen()
```
as “magic” that were necessary for the program to work. I’m still not entirely sure why the * is needed or the specifics of the Screen method. I think I might have seen one of the questions on Runestone have numbers in the parenthesis after ‘screen’.
The ability for the turtle to turn either left or right made the program significantly easier than if it only supported rotation in one direction or only supported coordinates. The early scrambled code questions and examples reinforced the process of using turtle, but it felt somewhat disconnected from what we’d done previously. Almost like this chapter was meant to be understood by someone who hadn’t read the previous chapters. In that way it felt fun because it was fairly easy. Having to “guess and check” to draw letters or drawings feels somewhat tedious but it’s also fun in some ways. Getting to watch the program run gives me an opportunity to see where the program fails graphically.
