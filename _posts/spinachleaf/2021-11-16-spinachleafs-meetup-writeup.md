How did it go?
	I attended the Python Monthly Meetup on September 8th. Overall, I found this experience to be very interesting. I heard a presentation about FastAPI, a web framework for Python. I didn’t understand a lot of what was discussed, but it was neat to be able to see someone present on the topic and gain exposure to it.

What did you learn?
	I learned that there are so many more things you can do with Python than I had ever even thought of. I still am not completely sure what a web framework is, but the presentation talked about a lot of them and the differences between them. Basically, I learned that there is a ton that I don’t know when it comes to Python.

Would you find value in this kind of event after class?
	I don’t see myself attending an event like this in the future. I am glad for my experience in a programming class, and I think it is a great basic skill for me to have. That being said, I do not anticipate continuing in my programming education after this course. I think I will have gained what I wanted out of this class by the end of the semester.

How was the experience different from your expectations?
	The meeting mostly focused on this single presentation, which is not what I expected. The presentation was succinct and well put together, and people stopped the presenter to ask clarifying questions more often than I thought they would. I anticipated there being a more formal question and answer session, but people interrupted the speaker and asked questions throughout the presentation.
	At one point, the presenter was explaining a specific mechanic of FastAPI using some jargon that I did not understand. Someone else stopped him and asked him to explain it in a more accessible way for newcomers. I thought this was really interesting and I do not think I expected this to happen in a meeting like this. It was much more beginner friendly than I thought it would be, but I still did not understand a lot of it because I do not have a strong technical background. I did appreciate the effort that was made, though.

Could you see yourself becoming a member of a professional community like this in the future?
	I cannot see myself becoming a member of a professional community like this. It was an interesting experience and I’m glad to have been to a meeting like this, but I do not think I will continue working in Python after this class. Again, I did enjoy it and I am happy to have had the opportunity to attend an event like this.
