# Reflection:
I had a lot of fun with this week’s assignments. I understand turtles better than I have understood anything else in class for the past several weeks. I don’t know what it is about them, but they make a lot more sense to me than the things we have been working on recently.

Specifically, writing my own turtle program to make it look like a sun, I was able to write a for loop with conditional statements that made sense to me. This statement was dependent on the number of repeats that had been made in the loop, and changed the angle at which the turtle moved. Before I created the sun shape, I figured out how to just create a circle, moving the turtle through 36 loops of moving forward 10 and left 10. This then led me to think of the sun shape idea. To sum it up: I like turtles.
