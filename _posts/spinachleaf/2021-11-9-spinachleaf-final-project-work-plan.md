I would like to create a turtle game for my final project.

The game would be a typing game where typing the correct words advances the turtle to the other side of the screen in order to win.
There would be 3 levels of difficulty, with each level having the same amount of time to complete but an increasing amount of letters to type in that time.
I think the data file would consist of the game settings, but Iâ€™m not exactly sure what that would look like yet.
The dictionaries might be the words that the user types to advance the turtle. I think the for loops are what advance the turtle if a word is typed correctly.
The functions are probably the movement of the turtle if you get the answer correct.

Over the next few weeks I will:
-Begin by making the turtle advance across the screen when I call a function. (Nov 17)
-Then I will try to build the correct data files and dictionaries to store the words that will be called. (Nov 24)
-I also need to figure out how to go up a level when the user beats the previous one. (Dec 1)
-I think the last step will be putting it all together in order with the win screen. (Dec 9)
