Here was my original project work plan:
"I would like to create a turtle game for my final project.

The game would be a typing game where typing the correct words advances the turtle to the other side of the screen in order to win. There would be 3 levels of difficulty, with each level having the same amount of time to complete but an increasing amount of letters to type in that time. I think the data file would consist of the game settings, but Iâ€™m not exactly sure what that would look like yet. The dictionaries might be the words that the user types to advance the turtle. I think the for loops are what advance the turtle if a word is typed correctly. The functions are probably the movement of the turtle if you get the answer correct.

Over the next few weeks I will: -Begin by making the turtle advance across the screen when I call a function. (Nov 17) -Then I will try to build the correct data files and dictionaries to store the words that will be called. (Nov 24) -I also need to figure out how to go up a level when the user beats the previous one. (Dec 1) -I think the last step will be putting it all together in order with the win screen. (Dec 9)"

I will be keeping the basic premise of my plan. Typing the correct input will move the turtle across the screen. I think I will change from words to letters. The letters will also appear randomly on the screen.

I believe I will also have to change my timeline, but I will update next week depending on how quickly I can get the `onkey` function to work. I've run into difficulty getting this. I get an error message that says, "TypeError: onkey() takes exactly 2 positional argument(s) (1 given) on line 21 in main.py" when I try to call it. I'm confused about this because I believe I have two arguments, as shown below:
```python
keyscreen.onkey(advance, "a")
```
I attended office hours with Misha and she suggested coming back to the `onkey` function after our next class. For now, I have included a `for` / `if` statement that shows that my `advance` function works, as seen below:

```python
for repeats in range(30):
  if repeats % 2 == 0:
    al.advance()
```

Al, my typing turtle, advances across the screen. I hope to make a quick fix to the `onkey` function after talking about it more in class tomorrow.

What I have accomplished so far is making my turtle that will serve as the progress bar at the bottom of the screen. Here is my code for him:
```python
class TypingTurtle(turtle.Turtle):
  def __init__(self, coordinates = [-190, -190], screen = keyscreen):
    turtle.Turtle.__init__(self)
    self.hideturtle()
    self.shape("circle")
    self.color("orange")
    self.speed(0)
    self.penup()
    self.goto(coordinates)
    self.showturtle()
    self.pendown()
    self.pensize(8)
    self.screen = screen
    
  #code for moving across screen
  def advance(self):
    self.speed(3)
    self.forward(25)
  #keyscreen.onkey(advance, "a")
```
I have the final line hashed out because I could not get `onkey` to work.

I have accomplished my first objective of getting the turtle to move across the screen, but I need it to be based on user interaction. This is my next immediate goal for next week, in addition to building the correct data files/dictionaries. 
Other than that, I believe my timeline will remain the same for now. I will update as necessary.
