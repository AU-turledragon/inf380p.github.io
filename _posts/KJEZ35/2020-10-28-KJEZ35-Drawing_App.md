This will be the first of a two part comment made. My code is building off the “Clicky Turtle” program. I  started this project by creating a checklist during class that would hold me accountable of a timeline. Unfortunately, this ended up being more of a formality being that my actual schedule made it difficult to stay on track. 
After my checklist was made, I actually started my brainstorming by physically drawing what I wanted my my interface to look at. I knew that my upcoming schedule was going to be tough on my progress so I started by just setting the initial setting of the program. 
I spent some time trying to set my functions and while loops however, found some difficulty in organizing my code. 

My concept was to build a paint like application that would allow a user to touch a paint color that would switch the color, of their paints. 
There would be other prompts that would allow the user to choose between mouse or keys, or erase the screen to start over.
