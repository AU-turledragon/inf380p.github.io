This will be the first of a two-part comment made. My code is building off the "Clicky Turtle" program. I  started this project by creating a checklist during class that would hold me accountable for a timeline. Unfortunately, this ended up being more of a formality. My actual schedule made it difficult to stay on track. 
After my checklist was made, I started my brainstorming by physically drawing what I wanted my interface to look at. I knew that my upcoming schedule would be tough on my progress, so I started by just setting the program's initial setting. 
I spent some time trying to set my functions and while loops; however, I found some difficulty organizing my code. 

My concept was to build a paint-like application that would allow users to touch a paint color that would switch their pigments' color. 
Other prompts would allow the user to choose between mouse or keys or erase the screen to start over.

I was able to go back and tie all the missing pieces together. As stated above, I had the basic layout of how I wanted my code to look. I played around with the next two days, and the missing pieces just clicked! So I will take it from the top in my description: 

I start off by creating the basic set up for every turtle program; creating the turtle and basic settings such as color and speed. I then create a variable to call for my font. The standard font is a bit too small for me. I then went to make my icons, basically importing various turtles and assigning them different naming conventions. This is basically where I ended my project before Wednesday. However, I knew what I wanted from my program. For instance, I liked the turtle "Kevin" with my mouse to follow my arrow key as it moved around the screen. To not merely drag or click. I had applied to the other two before and wanted something different. With some research, I found the "ondrag" function and spread it. After some test runs on a blank trinket, it was ready for my main code. I also found it easier to use the screen, formatting after the drag function. 

I then knew that to give the illusion of clicking on an icon, I would need a collision function. I had done this before in my "clicky turtle," it just took some brainstorming how I would apply it here. After some introductory trial and error, I got the first one to work. Then I just used my conditionals "if and elif" to call in different collisions. Using the same methodology, I applied a crash to apply my "keys" icon. I then went back and spread the "clear()" function to clear my drawing. The last thing I worked on was importing a shape. 

I created my own custom module with this neat code I found that made several triangles. I actually had to make numerous changes to the original code to make it the way I wanted. I used the same collision application to call it in. However, I was stuck when trying to erase it. I might ask for help on that part. 

Overall, this project was fun, and with just a little bit of time, I was able to make it all click the way I wanted. While I know my code is not very impressive compared to some others, I take pride in knowing that my skills and understanding are getting better little by little. Most of my code has been recycled from my other codes over the weeks with just small lookups for visuals. I followed the majority of my outline. However, I am just really slow at coding.
