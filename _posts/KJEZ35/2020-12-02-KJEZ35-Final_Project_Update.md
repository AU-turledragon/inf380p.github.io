title: "Final Project Update & Stand Up Report"
---


This post will start with my final reflection and responses to the questions posed in the announcements. Then display my last two reflections to give some background on this journey. After the reflections, I have my list of benchmarks. These are dated to show how they evolved. Last will be copies of two of my working draft trinkets. One is all the moving pieces; the other is the graphics and start screen.

I focused a lot of my time recently on creating a start screen and creating the graphics that I felt would bring my game to life. At the same time, the progress was a bit slower over the holiday break. I still made sure to work a little bit at a time on the project. I found some great resources that I feel will help me push to completion and tie everything in.

Are there any roadblocks ahead? Is there anything your group can do to help out?

At this point, the road blocks have to d with getting everything complete and bug free for a good code talk. My group has been a fantastic resource and very supportive during this project. I am incredibly thankful to finish the class with them.

2. Are your milestones ambitious enough? Make sure to include some stretch goals.

My milestones are plenty ambitious for me. I hope for this game to be a product that I will take pride in showing friends and family. I still feel that making certain level one is perfect will be the key to making the other levels perfect.

3. Are your milestones too ambitious? Make sure to break down the unglamorous parts of coding into chunks that reflect the actual work to be done.

At times it does seem that way. This has been especially true of importing my graphics and then seeing that my while loop was affected. In accomplishing one goal, it set me back several more steps that had already been completed.
4. Are you able to keep to your plan? Looking back at what you’ve done, is the difference accountable to bad planning (i.e. not anticipating what needed to be done), bad execution (not doing it), or something else?

I can keep to my plan; a hard push this week will bring everything to completion and give me next week to make minor adjustments. It will get done on time and ready for presentation.

5. Explicitly state what you’re working on next and what you intend to accomplish before you turn in your project.

Debugging my code with the graphics.
Collisions
Finishing graphics for cars
Make sure cars are using streets
Level changes
Classes
Report
Notes for code talk

Below is a review of my entire process from the start until now:

Original Idea; NOV 4, 2020:

For my final project, I want to create a game/simulator to teach new Army cadets basic military small unit tactics.
Army doctrine is written so that it is not reader-friendly and leaves new cadets confused with little understanding of their roles within a team or a squad element.
However, for cadets to earn their commission, they will be graded in a large scale exercise in the summer of their third year.
How to perform will ultimately determine their ranking within their class and profoundly impact their job appointment for the next eight years.

I want to start by creating a scenario where the turtle can receive user input to determine what position the individual wants to play.
I will find a way to import an image to make the turtle into a soldier. Then a player approaches a new situation; a quiz will pop up, asking how they want to come to this obstacle.
I will provide three answers that are related to that objective. To keep it instructional, only the correct answer will play out. However, there will be a tracker to keep score of their solutions.
As the player progresses in the game, scenarios will become more advanced, requiring more knowledge of tactics. If possible, I would like to apply a time clock that requires the user to make decisions quickly or be penalized.

Only the tactics that are required for their field exercise will be implemented. This project will be massive on the graphics but focus more on showing how a team or squad sized element would look.

Revised Project Idea; NOV 11, 2020:

This week I actually spent a lot of time working on classwork. However, most of that was catching up on the daily exercises and the extra credit. Yet, I set up office hours with Professor Elliot to discuss my plan and decided if I was choosing the appropriate project for a work portfolio. He made some really valid points regarding the turtle application. I have admitted I was already leaning towards that path, but he just solidified it for me. Major Changes:
I am going to use my turtle program still but change the actual game itâ€™s self. Instead of the learning game for cadets, I plan to gear a match to a broader audience. I saw a program that involved â€œturtle racesâ€ on the trinket. I look to take something similar but make it so that the player is racing against the computer. However, there will be obstacles in the way, and with each level, the turtles increase their speed. If your turtle hits an obstruction, he will be sent back to the begging. I will build on this idea as I actually work on the project. Roadblocks:
Overall, just being somewhat indecisive about what I wanted to do actually took up some time. I am not a creative person by nature, so thinking of an idea can be my most formidable obstacle. Data:
This will come in the form of instructions that will be prompted by user input. Classes:
Here I am having some issues using Python 3, so I will need to get the professor to help. I plan to use classes to build a template for creating turtles. Loops:
Both for loops and while loops will be implemented; however, I will need to see how to implement my for loops; I tend to favor while loops for games. The while loop will be used to create the collisions with obstacles. Conditionals:
If and elif statements will be used in the while loop to help with the collisions as well.

NOV 04, 2020

-[X] First, I would start by brainstorming the idea and drawing it out on paper.
-[X] Next, I would build out the primary introduction screen.
-[X] I would then move on to building the first level.
-[] Next would be building out the second level.
-[] Then would be building out the third level, and so on.

NOV 11, 2020

-[X] Move my code over from Python 3 to Pygame.
-[X] Get the right number of turtles/cars I want to have one my screen.
-[X] Next, I want to have the cars that are moving horizontally.

NOV 18, 2020

-[] Level one will need to have collisions in the form of explosions for all the moving pieces and objects.
-[] I want to tie in a clock to give the player sixty seconds to pass the level.
-[] I want to implement classes, maybe redo some of my code to make this possible?
-[] I need to tie in dicts. not sure where, I will have to think about this.
-[] I need to create a "hooray" screen for beating the level.
-[X] Start thinking about creating a home screen, to begin the game.
-[] Create a txt file with the instructions/directions of the game.
-[X] Finally find a way to make a level change to level two.
-[X] Import graphics/make graphics

DEC 02, 2020

-[] Tie in the missing pieces from the lists above.
-[] Merge my graphics Trinket and my Working Trinket.
-[] Cross reference code with assignment requirements, make sure I have touched on every requirement.
-[] 1500 Word Reflection
-[] Prepare notes for code talk and rehearse code.
-[] Submit final project before before the hit time.
