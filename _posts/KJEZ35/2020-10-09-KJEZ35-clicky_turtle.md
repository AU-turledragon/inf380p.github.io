With this activity I really put some time into it. I spent a whole day looking at old code I submitted and watched videos 
to help create graffics. Intially, I wanted to have a game that had a vertical blocks dropping and a bouncy ball that needed
to go into a goal. However, during the process I decided to go another way with the exersize. Because I struggled with 
loops so much, I made it point to use them a lot in this game. I have at least 1 while loop and two or three for loops. 
In the game you have a bouncing ball that can be hit with the turtle. There is a box that if the ball enters the area 
you will have fireworks drawn. The best part of this exersize was my three year old saw the bouncing ball and got excited. 
So I let him play the game and he was so excited seeing the fireworks after he scored! That was a memory for the books. I 
look forward to having him play some more of my games for this class!
