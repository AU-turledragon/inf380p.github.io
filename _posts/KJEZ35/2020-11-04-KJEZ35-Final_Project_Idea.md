title: "Final Project Idea"
---

For my final project, I want to create a game/simulator to teach new Army cadets basic military small unit tactics.
Army doctrine is written so that it is not reader-friendly and leaves new cadets confused with little understanding of their roles within a team or a squad element.
However, for cadets to earn their commission, they will be graded in a large scale exercise in the summer of their third year. 
How to perform will ultimately determine their ranking within their class and profoundly impact their job appointment for the next eight years. 

I want to start by creating a scenario where the turtle can receive user input to determine what position the individual wants to play.
I will find a way to import an image to make the turtle into a soldier. Then a player approaches a new situation; a quiz will pop up, asking how they want to approach this obstacle. 
I will provide three answers that are related to that objective. To keep it instructional, only the correct answer will play out. However, there will be a tracker to keep score of their solutions. 
As the player progresses in the game, scenarios will become more advanced, requiring more knowledge of tactics. If possible, I would like to apply a time clock that requires the user to make decisions quickly or be penalized. 

Only the tactics that are required for their field exercise will be implemented. This project will be massive on the graphics but focus more on showing how a team or squad sized element would look. 

-[] First, I would start by brainstorming the idea and drawing it out on paper. 
-[] Next, I would build out the primary introduction screen 
-[] I would then move on to building the first level. 
-[] Next would be building out the second level 
-[] Then would be building out the third level, and so on.
