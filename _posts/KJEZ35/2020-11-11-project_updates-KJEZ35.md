This week: 

This week I actually spent a lot of time working on classwork. However, most of that was catching up on the daily exercises and the extra credit. 
Yet, I set up office hours with Professor Elliot to discuss my plan and decided if I was choosing the appropriate project for a work portfolio. 
He made some really valid points regarding the turtle application. I have admitted I was already leaning towards that path, but he just solidified it for me. 
Major Changes: 

I am going to still use my turtle program but change the actual game it’s self. Instead of the learning game for cadets, I plan to gear a match to a broader audience. 
I saw a program that involved “turtle races” on the trinket. I look to take something similar but make it so that the player is racing against the computer. However, there will be obstacles in the way, and with each level, the turtles increase their speed. 
If your turtle hits an obstruction, he will be sent back to the begging. I will build on this idea as I actually work on the project.
Roadblocks: 

Overall, just being somewhat indecisive about what I wanted to do actually took up some time. I am not a creative person by nature, so thinking of an idea can be my most formidable obstacle. 
Data: 

This will come in the form of instructions that will be prompted by user input. 
Classes: 

Here I am having some issues using Python 3, so I will need to get the professor to help. I plan to use classes to build a template for creating turtles. 
Loops: 

Both for loops and while loops will be implemented; however, I will need to see how to implement my for loops; I tend to favor while loops for games. 
The while loop will be used to create the collisions with obstacles. 
Conditionals: 

If and elif statements will be used in the while loop to help with the collisions as well. 

- [X] First, I would start by brainstorming the idea and drawing it out on paper
- [ ] Next, I would build out the primary introduction screen
- [ ] I would then move on to building the first level.
- [ ] Next would be building out the second level
- [ ] Then would be building out the third level, and so on.

For a more detailed milestones list: 

NOV 11, 2020

- [ ] Move my code over from Python 3 to Pygame 
- [ ] Get the right number of turtles/cars I want to have one my screen
- [ ] Next I want to have the cars that are moving horizontally
