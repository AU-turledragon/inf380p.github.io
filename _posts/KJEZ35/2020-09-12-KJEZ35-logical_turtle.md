I was going over the people tab on our class page to see what assignemnts were missing from my column. I noticed that logical turtle was
missing, however I remember doing this activity and submiting it. What I think might have happened will be a good reflection post. So in the begining 
of this course I was struggling with grasping how to submit a pull request. I am positive that I must have submitted something, that did 
not properly link this to the posts. So who knows where that post went to! 

  Going back and reading my notes I can see how far I have come in just a month's time. I started by stating that 
  it took me awhile to simply import the turtle. I then did some basic commands to write a statement with the turtle. 
  I did apply a function to gather user input, by asking for the users name. I then call the variable "your_name" 
  in a response statemen. I then applied a simple math problem that used a if and else statement to give back a response 
  depending on the answer.
