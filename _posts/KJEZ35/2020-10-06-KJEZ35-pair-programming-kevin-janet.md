Reflection: 
Janet and I started this exersize by taking turns being the driver and the navigator. Janet was fairly well versed at setting up the 
coding so her part went by quickly. I took the oppertunity to ask questions on why and how she was coding through the first problem. 
I then made an attempt at the second and third problem. Me being still very much a novice, I took signifigantly more time to code and 
debug by codes. I even took the opperunity to send emails to the TA to help me work through some of my road bumps. Then Thursday I attened the 
study session where I was able to gain a better understanding of creating  for loops and while loops. I emailed Janet my results and then 
moved forward with the joint pull request, which I hope I am doing correctly. Overall it was a good exersize, however I feel that I 
was a bit slow and probably should have been paired with someone more on my skill level and understanding. 

Janet's reflection:
This is my first time doing pair programing. I helped Kevin on his code and saw how he learned new functions based on my words. It's kind of interesting. I remember how we figure out printing out the last line of Problem 5. But it was not what it normally looks like. Later, I tried another way to make it in a line without ''
Here's the new code for peoblem 5:
