Event Details: 

An Evening of Python Coding 
Tuesday, NOV 17, 2020 6:30-9:00pm (CST) 
Where Online, Austin Meet-Up 

This was my second meet-up; I initially signed up for another meeting the week before that was labeled; AWS Security with AWS Secret Manager, RDS My SQL, and Python. 
However, this presentation was not so much about python as it was about Amazon’s AWS. 

In the event I attended this past Tuesday, we had a presenter from Anaconda discussing a new program for plotting data called Hvplot. 
The program is free and open-source, allowing users to couple their programs with other programs to create plots and graphs. 
It was a bit heavy on data science as opposed to strictly programming. However, the presenter did use python to “clean data” and perform queries that could be presented on graphs.

 The subject matter correlated more to what I am learning in Data Wrangling and some of the file exercises we did in class. 
 I took the opportunity to present my data from three sources and present it in the graph using his module. 
 He walked me through a few examples and shared a few tips on using python to perform data cleaning. 

The event was a welcoming environment where I did not feel intimidated due to my novice programming background. 
I was not expecting the seminar to be so entrenched in data science; however, it worked out for me because of my data management and data wrangling courses.
After the seminar, I text a few friends and let them know about the meet-up and encouraged them to meet people interested in programming. 
I will most definitely revisit the website to see what other classes will be available. 

I could see myself becoming a member of this community if time permits. My long term goal is to gain a solid understanding of programming and tech to teach the skills to youth and adults in communities that do not have the resources to learn these skills. 
To me, giving back in this form would help share the passion for tech among diverse communities.
