 I'll start with a copy of my intial to do list: 
 
 -[x] First, I would start by brainstorming the idea and drawing it out on paper. 
 -[ ] Next, I would build out the primary introduction screen 
 -[x] I would then move on to building the first level. 
 -[ ] Next would be building out the second level 
 -[ ] Then would be building out the third level, and so on. 
 
 Here is the more in depth list from last clas: 
 
 - [x ] Move my code over from Python 3 to Pygame 
 - [x ] Get the right number of turtles/cars I want to have one my screen
 - [x  ] Next I want to have the cars that are moving horizontally

 So as we can see there is progress being made from my oringal list. I did scip the first goal of making an intro screen and went 
 right to the first level, however I plan to revisit this after my first level is complete. From last week's more in depth goals
 I was able to meet all the requirements I set out for myself. I spent a lot of time last week working my game and and really getting the 
 foundation down on the first level. I feel that if I get the first level just right, the next two levels will simply build off of the first, with 
 only slight modifications required to increase the difficulty. Here is the list for this week: 
 
 -[ ] Level one will need to have collisions in the form of explosions for all the moving pieces and objects. 
 -[ ] I want to tie in a clock to give the player sixty seconds to pass the level. 
 -[ ] I want to implement classes, maybe redo some of my code to make this possible? 
 -[ ] I need to tie in dicts. not sure where, I will have to think about this. 
 -[ ] I need to create a "hooray" screen for beating the level. 
 -[ ] Start thinking about creating a home screen, to begin the game. 
 -[ ] Creat a txt file with the instructions/directions of the game. 
 -[ ] Finally find a way to make a level change to level two.
 -[ ] import graphics/make graphics
 
 Overall, I plan on making a large push this week to tie in the rest of these goals. Again I am putting a lot of weight on level one 
 being that, once it is done, a lot of the code will be resuable. One new tool I have implemented into my coding time has been 
 voice recording myself after stints of coding. With this, the reasoning behind my code is fresh and will help with my final 
 code talk.
