So to reflect on last week's course material and my overall understadning. Lately, I have been enjoying Trinket, where 
in the begining it was a little frustrating. I played around on the website a little bit and learned some new commands which was fun. 
I think during class just due to the pace I feel a little lost or behind, however during the week I have the time to go back 
and reference my notes or the readings and I tend to get a better grasp on the concepts. For the class activity, I had to go back on 
my own time and do it over from scratch. I referenced Trinket for some basics then went over the key concepts that needed 
to be displayed. I read over chapter two and three and read some different articles on the concepts. I have a much clearer understanding 
of conditonals, operators and user input. After some time I actually started to make a little custom trinket that took
user input and displayed simple responses depending on if the answer was correct. For the turtlehack I was a little confused what was expected 
for the assignment. I ended up building a basic tic tac toe game that took used basic addition. I will find out if 
that was ok or completely off.
