Here is my criteria for success, in terms of a user ability or a program capability: 

[ ] Come with an idea that I want to implement or showcase. Maybe pick a Trinket I want to build on. 
[ ] Start by creating a function for taking input via the GUI. 
[ ] Set a function that allows user to build the program. 
[ ] Import the shapes the user can draw, and a function to erase and draw again. 
[ ] take opperunitites to have code reviewed twice to three time a week.
