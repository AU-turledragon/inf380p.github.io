### Final Project Idea and Plan
At the beginning of the year I shared that my most used application/software was Spotify, and that still holds true to this day. For my final project I want to create a data visualization tool that analyzes the top songs played on the app between 2010-2019, also including tools for top artists, genres and years for the decade. This project would be based on data collected using [Organize Your Music](http://organizeyourmusic.playlistmachinery.com/) for top Billboard songs worldwide. 

My goal for this project would be to create something interactive that users could toggle around with and compare through different variables like year and artist. In addition, I would like to learn how to insert images into code based on criteria that’s selected by the user to help filter the results based on the user’s preferences. There are other elements present within the .csv file per song, such as the tempo, the energy, whether the song was recorded live, etc. Although the goal of this project would be to focus on larger aspects of the data, it would also be fun to present what type of song has been most prevalent based on various characteristics.

My project plan would resemble the following:
*  Conduct data cleaning for .csv file for spotify data
* Perform preliminary inquiry such as finding median and mode for various fields (i.e., genre)
* Determine structure/layout of the tool
	* Research approaches to constructing determined layout
	* Receive feedback on layout
	* Implement feedback
* Create and insert images to depict the genres selected within the tool 
	* Receive feedback
	* Implement feedback
* Combine images and data visualization tool
* Receive feedback
	* Implement feedback
* **debug throughout this plan**
