### Final Project Update: Setbacks and Progress

After creating a very basic user interface sketch, I spent time trying to figure out how to construct dictionaries for various elements of the data that would allow for the user to retrieve a variety of information based on their request. I must say that this required effort in a portion of my brain that I’m 100 percent positive I’ve never exercised before. Having to go from conceptualizing potential requests to writing a program that knows how to respond was pretty challenging. 

Here’s what I’ve been able to come up with so far:

At this stage the dictionaries I’ve created are not all the way there -- they need some more TLC and brainstorming -- but I feel as though I’m on the right track to call the dictionaries within the functions I previously created. I’ve gone back and forth multiple times to try and figure out what kind of information a user would be most interested in learning from the dataset and then translating that into Python. 

This has set me back in my project plan unfortunately, meaning that I’ll likely not have enough time to create and embed images within the final visualization tool, but at the very least I do want to try utilizing `matplotlib` with even basic bar charts for years, top artists, etc.  I think I underestimated the amount of time it would take for me to not just come up with how the various dictionaries should be structured, but also having to debug the program along the way.

Some things that were brought up within the past week or so were the concern about duplicates within lists created for the dictionaries, how to create a counter using dictionaries in the context of the Spotify dataset, and how the response from the user’s input would be presented visually. Taking these things into account, my original project plan has been altered, as shown below, but I still hope to implement the additional module for visualization.

An updated plan can be found below:

*Conduct data cleaning for .csv file for spotify data  **[completed]**
* Perform preliminary inquiry such as finding median and mode for various fields (i.e., genre) **[completed]**
* Determine structure/layout of the tool **[completed]**
	* Research approaches to constructing determined layout
	* Receive feedback on layout
	* Implement feedback
* Create Dictionaries **[in progress]**
* Incorporate dictionaries within functions **[new]**
* ~~Create and insert images to depict the genres selected within the tool~~
	* ~~Receive feedback~~
	* ~~Implement feedback~~
* ~~Combine images~~ Import data visualization tool and create basic graphs **[updated]**
* Receive feedback
	* Implement feedback
