Since the last project update, I've made some additions to my code. This is the latest working version that I've come up with:

I've added the "food" for the snake game, the game checks for intersections, and displays a win screen when the snake moves through all the "food" pieces. 

I'm currently working on adding a counter that keeps track of the amount of time the snake hits the food. I'm having trouble displaying the counter so I'll have to spend some time debugging. 

By the end of the week, I'd like to get the following items done: 
- finishing the counter screen and debugging
- getting the "food" pieces to randomly appear across the screen
- adding levels
- adding comments throughout the current code to make it more readable
