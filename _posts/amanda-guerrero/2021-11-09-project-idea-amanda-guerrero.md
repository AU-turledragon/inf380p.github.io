For the final project, I want to go the Turtle game route. I think I want to create a snake game in python. I’m also floating around the idea of an “infinite runner” game type, reminiscent of ‘Flappy Bird.” At the moment, I’m learning more towards the snake game because that style of game more closely resembles that we’ve learned. I plan on taking the next few steps over the coming days: 

  First, I want to map out the look for the game
  Next, I’ll develop some ideas for the different levels and stages of the game
  Afterwards, I’ll start drafting and running some preliminary code for the game 
  Over the coming weeks, I’ll start elaborating on the more intricate details of the game 

I think that once I have a clear idea of how I want the game to look and run, I’ll have a good guide for the code that the game will require.
