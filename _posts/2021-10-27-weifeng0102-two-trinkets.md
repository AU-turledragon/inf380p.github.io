# Reflection:
I tried to define a function to draw teeth. After calling this function, I can customize the number of teeth. The first difficulty I encountered was calculating the angle of rotation and when to turn the angle in the nested loop.

After several attempts, I finally succeeded, but it seems that I have made the code a bit complicated. Turtle has to turn the angle twice after drawing a tooth. I am trying to simplify it.
