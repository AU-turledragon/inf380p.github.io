title: "First Reflection"

So currently I am trying to catch up on the course work being that I was a little confused at the beggining. The first class I 
was excited about taking on a new challenge and building a new skill set. I will have to admit that the github page was a little daunting and 
confusing trying to navigate. However after viewing it a few times I have started to become a little more familiar with it's content. The turtle exersize 
was fun to see code working in real time. I did have some issues with trying to fill in color, so I will have to work on that a little more. Also, 
I am not the best at math so trying to use the coordinate frame of reference was a challenge. I started to get the hang of it through 
some trial and error. Chapter one reading covered a lot if information as to why Python is preffered for students looking to begin their 
studies in programming. The reason is, Python has a syntax that is very similar to how humans communicate. Python is a dynamic langauge that uses an 
interpreter that allows it to be uploaded to any computer. The interpreter acts as a translator between the human and the CPU that speaks in it's 
own dialect of binary. Python as a dynamic lanngauge allows for users to learn coding much faster, however issues can arise from misspelling 
because you will not recieve a syntax error. 

The chapter One exersize: 
1) C - Seconday memory in a computer stores info for the long term even beyond the power circuit. 
2) A program is a set of instructions that specifies a computation. 

3) A compiler translates a program written in high level language by translating it one line at a time. An interpreter is used to execute a program 
in a high level language by translating it one line at a time. 
4) Python source files contain machine code. 
5) misspelling of "print"
6) main memory 
7) C? 
8) CPU = brain, main memory = thoughts, seconday memory= brain, input device = eyes, output = mouth. 
9) Spelling can usually fix syntax errors. 

Chapter two was very much a technical chapter that went into detail on how Variables, values and statements work. There were examples of how to use
Python to execute math problems.
