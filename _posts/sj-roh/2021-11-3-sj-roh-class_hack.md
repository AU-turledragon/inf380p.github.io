# Reflection:

For the trinket I made, I wanted to make sure that there were four distinct shape objects that I used, starting with a triangle (3-sided) moving up to a dodecagon (12-sided) by 3's. What I sharpened through this reflection, is my understanding of how a class can be structured with functions and methods. With a working knowledge of how to draw with the Turtle library, it was confusing to me at first how to program using the correct order in creating a class with methods, and finally calling them. It was very helpful to rewatch portions of this past week's lecture, and especially the focus on class extensions and how to instantiate objects. A light bulb moment happened for me when I re-learned that methods are available after defining new functions with the dot notation. Thus, this enabled for me to call methods using `.draw_triangle()`, `draw_hexagon()`, `draw_nonagon()`, and `draw_dodecagon()` at the end of my program. This also helped me understand that I can break a class down by functions one by one.
