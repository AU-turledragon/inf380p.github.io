## Update: 

For this week, I changed a lot of stuff. I managed to select two entirely different datasets for my project: US Births in 1978 and US Births in 2015. I definitely
made progress with the workflow of my code, and understanding how I want it to be structured. This was confusing to me until this past week, and getting to know concepts
we went over earlier in the semester helped a ton. I am running into issues with how to order the structure of my code, specifically with the two while loops that I implement.
I want to understand better where to place them so that the two menus I have run correctly and the right time. 

Below is the trinket code:

### New modifications moving forward:
- Review while loops, when to implement them 
- Review functions and where to place them in my code so each block of code runs in the correct order.

### New modifications (added items to my old checklist - copied below) FROM LAST WEEK:
- Must figure out how to deal with option 3: Creating a histogram, what are the necessary steps for the user to go through? (CHECK, new datasets solved this problem for me)
- Add code to carry out these ideas (learn how to incorporate if statements & for loops within each function specic to my plan) (In progress)
- How to distinguish the two data sets? I think this is a prime spot to provide some help text to differentiate the two data sets, especially for those not interested in basketball (CHECK, new and more interesting/applicable datasets solved this problem for me). 
- Learn how to incorporate dictionaries in program (CHECK)

## Old Plan:

### Project Idea:

For the final project, I have decided to do a data analysis project. I want to focus on using the tools that we learned in class over the semester to follow
Professor's recommendation of building an exploratory analysis tool for users to print out graphs (histogram) and summary statistics of data sets. These summary
statistics will include min, median, mean, sd, and max. The concept of uploading data sets and running a program for the users to input what they want to find, 
and for the results to be outputted is very interesting to me. Data sets with numeric variables will be important and necessary, but I am wondering if using data 
with categorical values will work in terms of finding the mean proportions for each value within each column. I want to explore the possibilies of using not just 
datasets with numeric variables, but categorical variables as well. I hope to use Python's built-in graphical output functions to print out the statistical graphs, 
but I also want to explore matplotlib as I have tiny experience using it. 

### Project Initial Work Plan (Milestones):

- Choose data files to use in the trinket. (CHECK)
- Work on gathering Runestone materials/chapters to review over, especially chapters with examples/exercises using data files. (In progress)
- Gather functions for each summary statistic to use. (CHECK)
- Brainstorm how to set up the structure of the program: CSV upload, class declarations, def functions, for-loops, correct attribute & methods to use. (In progress)
- Begin to code, but start light with foundational lines (CHECK). Make sure to get a thorough understanding of the structure of the program first. (In progress)
- Work out specific libraries I will need to load. (CHECK)
- Do research in Runestone and online for concepts I don't remember. Ask many questions and go to office hours. (In Progress)
