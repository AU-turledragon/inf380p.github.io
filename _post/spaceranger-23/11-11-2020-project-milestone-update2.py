**Reflection

For this week pull-request, I would like to cover the planning stages of the threat intelligence program. I first begin with laying out the critical components 
that I need to conduct research on APT 28, which is known as Fancy Bear. APT 28 is known as a Russian cyber group that cause significant damage to critical infrastructure worldwide 
and enjoys compromosing informaiton. To understand APT 28 over a two week period, I came up with several list for the programs to analyze against open source information: 

Associated Groups: Sofacy, Fancy Bear, Strontium
Intelligence Agency: Russiaâ€™s General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)
Military Unit -> 85th Main Special Service Center (GTsSS), unit 26165 and 74455
Keyword of Attacks: Phishing, Malware, DDoS, Distributed Denial-of-Service, Droborub, credential harvesting, espionage, Ukraine, Russia, United States

** Objectives going forward:
[] Find a news source to analyze the list against the website cyberscoop.com
[] Need to conduct use beautiful soap to pull data out of an HTML link. I am currently working through this step as I type this and will report back next week. 
[] Get beautiful soap to locate keywords within cyberscoop
