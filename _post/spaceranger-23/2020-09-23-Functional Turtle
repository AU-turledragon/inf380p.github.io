#Reflection 
# This assignment took a while for me to understand because I was attempting to go away from what I already know. In other words, I was attempting to re-write
my entire code. After a few breaks and conducting research online, something pop that I can create a function in side of a function to reduce the code size. I am 
not all the way there in fully understanding how to does this proficently, however, I believe I have made it to defining how to refactor an previous assignment.
