#Reflection:
# When I first begin this assignment, I did not know if I would like to hack a previous code or start with a new code. After debating the courses of actions for a little while I decided to use my previous code from a previous Trinket assignment to rework. I decided to replace grades with top technology companies. After working the assignment for a few hours I stumbled how to insert graphics into the code. I become bored and started clicking around and this is how I found option. I was not able to get every picture to work, however, I replace the pictures that did not work with Tina the Turtle spelling the name of the company. The assignment taught me if one process does not work, how to go back and think of anothe way to execute.
