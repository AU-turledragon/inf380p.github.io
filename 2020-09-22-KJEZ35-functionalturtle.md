This topic overall was little confusing for me. While I was able to utilize the def function,
I feel as if I did not shorten the amount of code I had intially typed. So I will have to do some 
extra practice on this section. I think it would be helpful for me to implement the function from 
the start as oppose to me going back into an existing one.
