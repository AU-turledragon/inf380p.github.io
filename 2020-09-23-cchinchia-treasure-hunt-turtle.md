## Relection:
From this practice, I become more familiar with Python's mathematical functions as well as the importance of the variable types. For example, I use several math functions with this turtle, including square root and absolute number. 
After calculating the distance between desired coordinates and user's coordinates (using square root), the turtle changes its color based on the distance. It took me a while to figure out how to insert the distance variables into the string's placeholder. I learned to use [string format() method](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_format.asp) this time.
